<h2>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; LE ROI EST MORT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;There; that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where they buried
Frenchman,&rdquo; said Andrew&mdash;known as River Andrew.&nbsp; For
there was another Andrew who earned his living on the sea.</p>
<p>River Andrew had conducted the two gentlemen from &ldquo;The Black
Sailor&rdquo; to the churchyard by their own request.&nbsp; A message
had been sent to him in the morning that this service would be required
of him, to which he had returned the answer that they would have to
wait until the evening.&nbsp; It was his day to go round Marshford way
with dried fish, he said; but in the evening they could see the church
if they still set their minds on it.</p>
<p>River Andrew combined the light duties of grave-digger and clerk
to the parish of Farlingford in Suffolk with a small but steady business
in fish of his own drying, nets of his own netting, and pork slain and
dressed by his own weather-beaten hands.</p>
<p>For Farlingford lies in that part of England which reaches seaward
toward the Fatherland, and seems to have acquired from that proximity
an insatiable appetite for sausages and pork.&nbsp; On these coasts
the killing of pigs and the manufacture of sausages would appear to
employ the leisure of the few, who for one reason or another have been
deemed unfit for the sea.&nbsp; It is not our business to inquire why
River Andrew had never used the fickle element.&nbsp; All that lay in
the past.&nbsp; And in a degree he was saved from the disgrace of being
a landsman by the smell of tar and bloaters that heralded his coming,
by the blue jersey and the brown homespun trousers which he wore all
the week, and by the saving word which distinguished him from the poor
inland lubbers who had no dealings with water at all.</p>
<p>He had this evening laid aside his old sou&rsquo;wester&mdash;worn
in fair and foul weather alike&mdash;for his Sunday hat.&nbsp; His head-part
was therefore official and lent additional value to the words recorded.&nbsp;
He spoke them, moreover, with a dim note of aggressiveness which might
only have been racy of a soil breeding men who are curt and clear of
speech.&nbsp; But there was more than an East Anglian bluffness in the
statement and the manner of its delivery, as his next observation at
once explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passen thinks it&rsquo;s over there by the yew-tree&mdash;but
he&rsquo;s wrong.&nbsp; That there one was a wash-up found by old Willem
the lighthouse keeper one morning early.&nbsp; No! this is where Frenchman
was laid by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He indicated with the toe of his sea-boot a crumbling grave which
had never been distinguished by a headstone.&nbsp; The grass grew high
all over Farlingford churchyard, almost hiding the mounds where the
forefathers slept side by side with the nameless &ldquo;wash-ups,&rdquo;
to whom they had extended a last hospitality.</p>
<p>River Andrew had addressed his few remarks to the younger of his
two companions, a well-dressed, smartly set-up man of forty or thereabouts,
who in turn translated the gist of them into French for the information
of his senior, a little white-haired gentleman whom he called &ldquo;Monsieur
le Marquis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke glibly enough in either tongue, with a certain indifference
of manner.&nbsp; This was essentially a man of cities, and one better
suited to the pavement than the rural quiet of Farlingford.&nbsp; To
have the gift of tongues is no great recommendation to the British born,
and River Andrew looked askance at this fine gentleman while he spoke
French.&nbsp; He had received letters at the post-office under the name
of Dormer Colville: a name not unknown in London and Paris, but of which
the social fame had failed to travel even to Ipswich, twenty miles away
from this mouldering churchyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting on for twenty-five years come Michaelmas,&rdquo;
put in River Andrew.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t digger then; but I
remember the burial well enough.&nbsp; And I remember Frenchman&mdash;same
as if I see him yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He plucked a blade of grass from the grave and placed it between
his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He were a mystery, he were,&rdquo; he added, darkly, and turned
to look musingly across the marshes toward the distant sea.&nbsp; For
River Andrew, like many hawkers of cheap wares, knew the indirect commercial
value of news.</p>
<p>The little white-haired Frenchman made a gesture of the shoulders
and outspread hands indicative of a pious horror at the condition of
this neglected grave.&nbsp; The meaning of his attitude was so obvious
that River Andrew shifted uneasily from one foot to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he don&rsquo;t take no account
of the graves.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s what you might call a bookworm.&nbsp;
Always a sitting indoors reading books and pictures.&nbsp; Butcher Franks
turns his sheep in from time to time.&nbsp; But along of these tempests
and the hot sun the grass has shot up a bit.&nbsp; Frenchman&rsquo;s
no worse off than others.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s some as are fallen
in altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He indicated one or two graves where the mound had sunk, and suggestive
hollows were visible in the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, it&rsquo;s the coffin that bu&rsquo;sts in beneath
the weight, then it&rsquo;s the bones,&rdquo; he added, with that grim
realism which is begotten of familiarity.</p>
<p>Dormer Colville did not trouble to translate these general truths.&nbsp;
He suppressed a yawn as he contemplated the tottering headstones of
certain master-mariners and Trinity-pilots taking their long rest in
the immediate vicinity.&nbsp; The churchyard lay on the slope of rising
ground upon which the village of Farlingford straggled upward in one
long street.&nbsp; Farlingford had once been a town of some commercial
prosperity.&nbsp; Its story was the story of half a dozen ports on this
coast&mdash;a harbour silted up, a commerce absorbed by a more prosperous
neighbour nearer to the railway.</p>
<p>Below the churchyard was the wide street which took a turn eastward
at the gates and led straight down to the river-side.&nbsp; Farlingford
Quay&mdash;a little colony of warehouses and tarred huts&mdash;was separated
from Farlingford proper by a green, where the water glistened at high
tide.&nbsp; In olden days the Freemen of Farlingford had been privileged
to graze their horses on the green.&nbsp; In these later times the lord
of the manor pretended to certain rights over the pasturage, which Farlingford,
like one man, denied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mystery,&rdquo; repeated River Andrew, waiting very clearly
for Mr. Dormer Colville to translate the suggestive word to the French
gentleman.&nbsp; But Colville only yawned.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s
few in Farlingford as knew Frenchman as well as I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Colville walked toward the church porch, which seemed to appeal
to his sense of the artistic; for he studied the Norman work with the
eye of a connoisseur.&nbsp; He was evidently a cultured man, more interested
in a work of art than in human story.</p>
<p>River Andrew, seeing him depart, jingled the keys which he carried
in his hand, and glanced impatiently toward the older man.&nbsp; The
Marquis de Gemosac, however, ignored the sound as completely as he had
ignored River Andrew&rsquo;s remarks.&nbsp; He was looking round him
with eyes which had once been dark and bright, and were now dimly yellow.&nbsp;
He looked from tomb to tomb, vainly seeking one that should be distinguished,
if only by the evidence of a little care at the hands of the living.&nbsp;
He looked down the wide grass-grown street&mdash;partly paved after
the manner of the Netherlands&mdash;toward the quay, where the brown
river gleamed between the walls of the weather-beaten brick buildings.&nbsp;
There was a ship lying at the wharf, half laden with hay; a coasting
craft from some of the greater tidal rivers, the Orwell or the Blackwater.&nbsp;
A man was sitting on a piece of timber on the quay, smoking as he looked
seaward.&nbsp; But there was no one else in sight.&nbsp; For Farlingford
was half depopulated, and it was tea-time.&nbsp; Across the river lay
the marshes, unbroken by tree or hedge, barren of even so much as a
hut.&nbsp; In the distance, hazy and grey in the eye of the North Sea,
a lighthouse stood dimly, like a pillar of smoke.&nbsp; To the south&mdash;so
far as the eye could pierce the sea haze&mdash;marshes.&nbsp; To the
north&mdash;where the river ran between bare dykes&mdash;marshes.</p>
<p>And withal a silence which was only intensified by the steady hum
of the wind through the gnarled branches of the few churchyard trees
which turn a crouching back toward the ocean.</p>
<p>In all the world&mdash;save, perhaps, in the Arctic world&mdash;it
would be hard to find a picture emphasising more clearly the fact that
a man&rsquo;s life is but a small matter, and the memory of it like
the seed of grass upon the wind to be blown away and no more recalled.</p>
<p>The bearer of one of the great names of France stood knee-deep in
the sun-tanned grass and looked slowly round as if seeking to imprint
the scene upon his memory.&nbsp; He turned to glance at the crumbling
church behind him, built long ago by men speaking the language in which
his own thoughts found shape.&nbsp; He looked slowly from end to end
of the ill-kept burial ground, crowded with the bones of the nameless
and insignificant dead, who, after a life passed in the daily struggle
to wrest a sufficiency of food from a barren soil, or the greater struggle
to hold their own against a greedy sea, had faded from the memory of
the living, leaving naught behind them but a little mound where the
butcher put his sheep to graze.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Gemosac was so absorbed in his reflections that he seemed
to forget his surroundings and stood above the grave, pointed out to
him by River Andrew, oblivious to the cold wind that blew in from the
sea, deaf to the clink of the sexton&rsquo;s inviting keys, forgetful
of his companion who stood patiently waiting within the porch.&nbsp;
The Marquis was a little bent man, spare of limb, heavy of shoulder,
with snow-white hair against which his skin, brown and wrinkled as a
walnut shell, looked sallow like old ivory.&nbsp; His face was small
and aquiline; not the face of a clever man, but clearly the face of
an aristocrat.&nbsp; He had the grand manner too, and that quiet air
of self-absorption which usually envelops the bearers of historic names.</p>
<p>Dormer Colville watched him with a good-natured patience which pointed,
as clearly as his attitude and yawning indifference, to the fact that
he was not at Farlingford for his own amusement.</p>
<p>Presently he lounged back again toward the Marquis and stood behind
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind is cold, Marquis,&rdquo; he said, pleasantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One of the coldest spots in England.&nbsp; What would Mademoiselle
say if I allowed you to take a chill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Gemosac turned and looked at him over his shoulder with a smile
full of pathetic meaning.&nbsp; He spread out his arms in a gesture
indicative of horror at the bleakness of the surroundings; at the mournfulness
of the decaying village; the dreary hopelessness of the mouldering church
and tombs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking, my friend,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
was all.&nbsp; It is not surprising . . . that one should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville heaved a sigh and said nothing.&nbsp; He was, it seemed,
essentially a sympathetic man; not of a thoughtful habit himself, but
tolerant of thought in others.&nbsp; It was abominably windy and cold,
although the corn was beginning to ripen; but he did not complain.&nbsp;
Neither did he desire to hurry his companion in any way.</p>
<p>He looked at the crumbling grave with a passing shadow in his clever
and worldly eyes, and composed himself to await his friend&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<p>In his way he must have been a philosopher.&nbsp; His attitude did
not suggest that he was bored, and yet it was obvious that he was eminently
out of place in this remote spot.&nbsp; He had nothing in common, for
instance, with River Andrew, and politely yawned that reminiscent fish-curer
into silence.&nbsp; His very clothes were of a cut and fashion never
before seen in Farlingford.&nbsp; He wore them, too, with an air rarely
assumed even in the streets of Ipswich.</p>
<p>Men still dressed with care at this time; for d&rsquo;Orsay was not
yet dead, though his fame was tarnished.&nbsp; Mr. Dormer Colville was
not a dandy, however.&nbsp; He was too clever to go to that extreme
and too wise not to be within reach of it in an age when great tailors
were great men, and it was quite easy to make a reputation by clothes
alone.</p>
<p>Not only was his dress too fine for Farlingford, but his personality
was not in tune with this forgotten end of England.&nbsp; His movements
were too quick for a slow-moving race of men; no fools, and wiser than
their midland brethren; slow because they had yet to make sure that
a better way of life had been discovered than that way in which their
Saxon forefathers had always walked.</p>
<p>Colville seemed to look at the world with an exploiting eye.&nbsp;
He had a speculative mind.&nbsp; Had he lived at the end of the Victorian
era instead of the beginning he might have been a notable financier.&nbsp;
His quick glance took in all Farlingford in one comprehensive verdict.&nbsp;
There was nothing to be made of it.&nbsp; It was uninteresting because
it obviously had no future, nor encouraged any enterprise.&nbsp; He
looked across the marshes indifferently, following the line of the river
as it made its devious way between high dykes to the sea.&nbsp; And
suddenly his eye lighted.&nbsp; There was a sail to the south.&nbsp;
A schooner was standing in to the river mouth, her sails glowing rosily
in the last of the sunset light.</p>
<p>Colville turned to see whether River Andrew had noticed, and saw
that landsman looking skyward with an eye that seemed to foretell the
early demise of a favouring wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Last Hope,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said,
in answer to Dormer Colville&rsquo;s question.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it will
take all Seth Clubbe&rsquo;s seamanship to save the tide.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
Last Hope.&rsquo;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a &lsquo;Hope,&rsquo; built
at Farlingford, and that&rsquo;s the last, for the yard is closed and
there&rsquo;s no more building now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac had turned away from the grave, but as Colville
approached him he looked back to it with a shake of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After eight centuries of splendour, my friend,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can that be the end&mdash;that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the end,&rdquo; answered Colville, cheerfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is only the end of a chapter.&nbsp; <i>Le roi est mort&mdash;vive
le roi!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>He pointed with his stick, as he spoke, to the schooner creeping
in between the dykes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; VIVE LE ROI</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; had been expected for some days.&nbsp;
It was known in Farlingford that she was foul, and that Captain Clubbe
had decided to put her on the slip-way at the end of the next voyage.&nbsp;
Captain Clubbe was a Farlingford man.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo;
was a Farlingford built ship, and Seth Clubbe was not the captain to
go past his own port for the sake of saving a few pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farlingford&rsquo;s his nation,&rdquo; they said of him down
at the quay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Born and bred here, man and boy.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
not likely to put her into a Thames dry-dock while the slip-way&rsquo;s
standing empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the village gossips naturally connected the arrival of the two
gentlemen from London with the expected return of &ldquo;The Last Hope.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Captain Clubbe was known to have commercial relations with France.&nbsp;
It was currently reported that he could speak the language.&nbsp; No
one could tell the number of his voyages backward and forward from the
Bay to Bristol, to Yarmouth, and even to Bergen, carrying salt-fish
to those countries where their religion bids them eat that which they
cannot supply from their own waters, and bringing back wine from Bordeaux
and brandy from Charente.</p>
<p>It is not etiquette, however, on these wind-swept coasts to inquire
too closely into a man&rsquo;s business, and, as in other places, the
talk was mostly among those who knew the least&mdash;namely, the women.&nbsp;
There had been a question of repairing the church.&nbsp; The generation
now slowly finding its way to its precincts had discussed the matter
since their childhood and nothing had come of it.</p>
<p>One bold spirit put forth the suggestion that the two gentlemen were
London architects sent down by the Queen to see to the church.&nbsp;
But the idea fell to the ground before the assurance from Mrs. Clopton&rsquo;s
own lips that the old gentleman was nothing but a Frenchman.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clopton kept &ldquo;The Black Sailor,&rdquo; and knew a deal
more than she was ready to tell people; which is tantamount to saying
that she was a woman in a thousand.&nbsp; It had leaked out, however,
that the spokesman of the party, Mr. Dormer Colville, had asked Mrs.
Clopton whether it was true that there was claret in the cellars of
&ldquo;The Black Sailor.&rdquo;&nbsp; And any one having doubts could
satisfy himself with a sight of the empty bottles, all mouldy, standing
in the back yard of the inn.</p>
<p>They were wine-merchants from France, concluded the wiseacres of
Farlingford over their evening beer.&nbsp; They had come to Farlingford
to see Captain Clubbe.&nbsp; What could be more natural!&nbsp; For Farlingford
was proud of Captain Clubbe.&nbsp; It so often happens that a man going
out into the world and making a great name there, forgets his birthplace
and the rightful claim to a gleam of reflected glory which the relations
of a great man&mdash;who have themselves stayed at home and done nothing&mdash;are
always ready to consider their due reward for having shaken their heads
over him during the earlier struggles.</p>
<p>Though slow of tongue, the men of Farlingford were of hospitable
inclination.&nbsp; They were sorry for Frenchmen, as for a race destined
to smart for all time under the recollection of many disastrous defeats
at sea.&nbsp; And of course they could not help being ridiculous.&nbsp;
Heaven had made them like that while depriving them of any hope of ever
attaining to good seamanship.&nbsp; Here was a foreigner, however, cast
up in their midst, not by the usual channel indeed, but by a carriage
and pair from Ipswich.&nbsp; He must feel lonesome, they thought, and
strange.&nbsp; They, therefore, made an effort to set him at his ease,
and when they met him in &ldquo;the street&rdquo; jerked their heads
at him sideways.&nbsp; The upward jerk is less friendly and usually
denotes the desire to keep strictly within the limits of acquaintanceship.&nbsp;
To Mr. Dormer Colville they gave the upward lift of the chin as to a
person too facile in speech to be desirable.</p>
<p>The dumbness of the Marquis de Gemosac appealed perhaps to a race
of seafaring men very sparingly provided by nature with words in which
to clothe thoughts no less solid and sensible by reason of their terseness.&nbsp;
It was at all events unanimously decided that everything should be done
to make the foreigner welcome until the arrival of &ldquo;The Last Hope.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A similar unanimity characterised the decision that he must without
delay be shown Frenchman&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>River Andrew&rsquo;s action and the unprecedented display of his
Sunday hat on a week-day were nothing but the outcome of a deep-laid
scheme.&nbsp; Mrs. Clopton had been instructed to recommend the gentlemen
to inspect the church, and the rest had been left to the wit of River
Andrew, a man whose calling took him far and wide, and gave him opportunities
of speech with gentlefolk.</p>
<p>These opportunities tempted River Andrew to go beyond his instructions
so far as to hint that he could, if encouraged, make disclosures of
interest respecting Frenchman.&nbsp; Which was untrue; for River Andrew
knew no more than the rest of Farlingford of a man who, having been
literally cast up by the sea at their gates, had lived his life within
those gates, had married a Farlingford woman, and had at last gone the
way of all Farlingford without telling any who or what he was.</p>
<p>From sundry open cottage doors and well-laden tea-tables glances
of inquiry were directed toward the strangers&rsquo; faces as they walked
down the street after having viewed the church.&nbsp; Some prescient
females went so far as to state that they could see quite distinctly
in the elder gentleman&rsquo;s demeanour a sense of comfort and consolation
at the knowledge thus tactfully conveyed to him that he was not the
first of his kind to be seen in Farlingford.</p>
<p>Hard upon the heels of the visitors followed River Andrew, wearing
his sou&rsquo;wester now and carrying the news that &ldquo;The Last
Hope&rdquo; was coming up on the top of the tide.</p>
<p>Farlingford lies four miles from the mouth of the river, and no ship
can well arrive unexpected at the quay; for the whole village may see
her tacking up under shortened sail, heading all ways, sometimes close-hauled,
and now running free as she follows the zigzags of the river.</p>
<p>Thus, from the open door, the villagers calculated the chances of
being able to finish the evening meal at leisure and still be down at
the quay in time to see Seth Clubbe bring his ship alongside.&nbsp;
One by one the men of Farlingford, pipe in mouth, went toward the river,
not forgetting the kindly, sideward jerk of the head for the old Frenchman
already waiting there.</p>
<p>It was nearly the top of the tide and the clear green water swelled
and gurgled round the weedy piles of the quay, bringing on its surface
tokens from the sea&mdash;shadowy jelly-fish, weed, and froth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; was quite close at hand now, swinging up
in mid-stream.&nbsp; The sun had set and over the marshes the quiet
of evening brooded hazily.&nbsp; Captain Clubbe had taken in all sail
except a jib.&nbsp; His anchor was swinging lazily overside, ready to
drop.&nbsp; The watchers on the quay could note the gentle rise and
fall of the crack little vessel as the tide lifted her from behind.&nbsp;
She seemed to be dancing to her home like a maiden back from school.&nbsp;
The swing of her tapering masts spoke of the heaving seas she had left
behind.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Farlingford that no one spoke.&nbsp; River
Andrew was already in his boat, ready to lend a hand should Captain
Clubbe wish to send a rope ashore.&nbsp; But it was obvious that the
captain meant to anchor in the stream for the night: so obvious that
if any one on shore had mentioned the conclusion his speech would have
called for nothing but a contemptuous glance from the steady blue eyes
all round him.</p>
<p>It was equally characteristic of a Farlingford ship that there were
no greetings from the deck.&nbsp; Those on shore could clearly perceive
the burly form of Captain Clubbe, standing by the weather rigging.&nbsp;
Wives could distinguish their husbands, and girls their lovers; but,
as these were attending to their business with a taciturn concentration,
no hand was raised in salutation.</p>
<p>The wind had dropped now.&nbsp; For these are coasts of quiet nights
and boisterous days.&nbsp; The tide was almost slack.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Last Hope&rdquo; was scarcely moving, and in the shadowy light looked
like a phantom ship sailing out of a dreamy sunset sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly the silence was broken, so unexpectedly, so dramatically,
that the old Frenchman, to whose nature such effects would naturally
appeal with a lightning speed, rose to his feet and stood looking with
startled eyes toward the ship.&nbsp; A clear strong voice had broken
joyously into song, and the words it sang were French:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;C&rsquo;est le Hasard,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qui,
t&ocirc;t ou tard,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ici bas
nous seconde;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D&rsquo;un
bout du monde<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A l&rsquo;autre
bout,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Le Hasard seul fait tout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only were the words incongruous with their quaint, sadly gay
air of a dead epoch of music and poetry; but the voice was in startling
contrast to the tones of a gruff and slow-speaking people.&nbsp; For
it was a clear tenor voice with a ring of emotion in it, half laughter,
half tears, such as no Briton could compass himself, or hear in another
without a dumb feeling of shame and shyness.</p>
<p>But those who heard it on the shore&mdash;and all Farlingford was
there by this time&mdash;only laughed curtly.&nbsp; Some of the women
exchanged a glance and made imperfectly developed gestures, as of a
tolerance understood between mothers for anything that is young and
inconsequent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotten Loo Barebone back at any rate,&rdquo; said
a man, bearing the reputation of a wit.&nbsp; And after a long pause
one or two appreciators answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; and laughed good-humouredly.</p>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac sat down again, with a certain effort at self-control,
on the balk of timber which had been used by some generations of tide-watchers.&nbsp;
He turned and exchanged a glance with Dormer Colville, who stood at
his side leaning on his gold-headed cane.&nbsp; Colville&rsquo;s expression
seemed to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you what it would be.&nbsp; But wait: there is more
to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His affable eyes made a round of the watching faces, and even exchanged
a sympathetic smile with some, as if to hint that his clothes were only
fine because he belonged to a fine generation, but that his heart was
as human as any beating under a homelier coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Passen,&rdquo; said one woman to another, behind
the corner of her apron, within Colville&rsquo;s hearing.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
takes a deal to bring him out o&rsquo; doors nowadays, and little Sep
and&mdash;Miss Miriam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dormer Colville heard the words.&nbsp; And he heard something unspoken
in the pause before the mention of the last name.&nbsp; He did not look
at once in the direction indicated by a jerk of the speaker&rsquo;s
thumb, but waited until a change of position enabled him to turn his
head without undue curiosity.&nbsp; He threw back his shoulders and
stretched his legs after the manner of one cramped by standing too long
in one attitude.</p>
<p>A hundred yards farther up the river, where the dyke was wider, a
grey-haired man was walking slowly toward the quay.&nbsp; In front of
him a boy of ten years was endeavouring to drag a young girl toward
the jetty at a quicker pace than she desired.&nbsp; She was laughing
at his impetuosity and looking back toward the man who followed them
with the abstraction and indifference of a student.</p>
<p>Colville took in the whole picture in one quick comprehensive glance.&nbsp;
But he turned again as the singer on board &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo;
began another verse.&nbsp; The words were clearly audible to such as
knew the language, and Colville noted that the girl turned with a sudden
gravity to listen to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Un tel qu&rsquo;on vantait<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par
hasard &eacute;tait<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D&rsquo;origine
assez mince;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par hasard il
plut,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par hasard il fut<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron,
ministre, et prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Clubbe&rsquo;s harsh voice broke into the song with the order
to let go the anchor.&nbsp; As the ship swung to the tide the steersman,
who wore neither coat nor waistcoat, could be seen idly handling the
wheel still, though his duties were necessarily at an end.&nbsp; He
was a young man, and a gay salutation of his unemployed hand toward
the assembled people&mdash;as if he were sure that they were all friends&mdash;stamped
him as the light-hearted singer, so different from the Farlingford men,
so strongly contrasted to his hearers, who nevertheless jerked their
heads sideways in response.&nbsp; He had, it seemed, rightly gauged
the feelings of these cold East Anglians.&nbsp; They were his friends.</p>
<p>River Andrew&rsquo;s boat was alongside &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo;
now.&nbsp; Some one had thrown him a rope, which he had passed under
his bow thwart and now held with one hand, while with the other he kept
his distance from the tarry side of the ship.&nbsp; There was a pause
until the schooner felt her moorings, then Captain Clubbe looked over
the side and nodded a curt salutation to River Andrew, bidding him,
by the same gesture, wait a minute until he had donned his shore-going
jacket.&nbsp; The steersman was pulling on his coat while he sought
among the crowd the faces of his more familiar friends.&nbsp; He was,
it seemed, a privileged person, and took it for granted that he should
go ashore with the captain.&nbsp; He was, perhaps, one of those who
seemed to be privileged at their birth by Fate, and pass through life
on the sunny side with a light step and laughing lips.</p>
<p>Captain Clubbe was the first to step ashore, with one comprehensive
nod of the head for all Farlingford.&nbsp; Close on his heels the younger
sailor was already returning the greetings of his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Loo!&rdquo; they said; or, &ldquo;How do, Barebone?&rdquo;&nbsp;
For their tongues are no quicker than their limbs, and to this day,
&ldquo;How do?&rdquo; is the usual greeting.</p>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac, who was sitting in the background, gave a
sharp little exclamation of surprise when Barebone stepped ashore, and
turned to Dormer Colville to say in an undertone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;but you need say nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised you,&rdquo; answered Colville, carelessly, &ldquo;that
I should tell you nothing till you had seen him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; THE RETURN OF &ldquo;THE LAST HOPE&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Not only France, but all Europe, had at this time to reckon with
one who, if, as his enemies said, was no Bonaparte, was a very plausible
imitation of one.</p>
<p>In 1849 France, indeed, was kind enough to give the world a breathing
space.&nbsp; She had herself just come through one of those seething
years from which she alone seems to have the power of complete recovery.&nbsp;
Paris had been in a state of siege for four months; not threatened by
a foreign foe, but torn to pieces by internal dissension.&nbsp; Sixteen
thousand had been killed and wounded in the streets.&nbsp; A ministry
had fallen.&nbsp; A ministry always does fall in France.&nbsp; Bad weather
may bring about such a descent at any moment.&nbsp; A monarchy had been
thrown down&mdash;a king had fled.&nbsp; Another king; and one who should
have known better than to put his trust in a people.</p>
<p>Half a dozen generals had attempted to restore order in Paris and
confidence in France.&nbsp; Then, at the very end of 1848, the fickle
people elected this Napoleon, who was no Bonaparte, President of the
new Republic, and Europe was accorded a breathing space.&nbsp; At the
beginning of 1849 arrangements were made for it&mdash;military arrangements&mdash;and
the year was almost quiet.</p>
<p>It was in the summer of the next year, 1850, that the Marquis de
Gemosac journeyed to England.&nbsp; It was not his first visit to the
country.&nbsp; Sixty years earlier he had been hurried thither by a
frenzied mother, a little pale-faced boy, not bright or clever, but
destined to pass through days of trial and years of sorrow which the
bright and clever would scarcely have survived.&nbsp; For brightness
must always mean friction, while cleverness will continue to butt its
head against human limitations so long as men shall walk this earth.</p>
<p>He had been induced to make this journey thus, in the evening of
his days, by the Hope, hitherto vain enough, which many Frenchmen had
pursued for half a century.&nbsp; For he was one of those who refused
to believe that Louis XVII. had died in the prison of the Temple.</p>
<p>Not once, but many times, Dormer Colville laughingly denied any responsibility
in the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not even tell the story as it was told to me,&rdquo;
he said to the Marquis de Gemosac, to the Abb&eacute; Touvent and to
the Comtesse de Chantonnay, whom he met frequently enough at the house
of his cousin, Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, in that which is now the Province
of the Charente Inf&eacute;rieure.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not even tell
you the story as it was told to me, until one of you has seen the man.&nbsp;
And then, if you ask me, I will tell you.&nbsp; It is nothing to me,
you understand.&nbsp; I am no dreamer, but a very material person, who
lives in France because he loves the sunshine, and the cuisine, and
the good, kind hearts, which no government or want of government can
deteriorate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Madame de Chantonnay, who liked Dormer Colville&mdash;with whom
she admitted she always felt herself in sympathy&mdash;smiled graciously
in response to his gallant bow.&nbsp; For she, too, was a materialist
who loved the sunshine and the cuisine; more especially the cuisine.</p>
<p>Moreover, Colville never persuaded the Marquis de Gemosac to come
to England.&nbsp; He went so far as to represent, in a realistic light,
the discomforts of the journey, and only at the earnest desire of many
persons concerned did he at length enter into the matter and good-naturedly
undertake to accompany the aged traveller.</p>
<p>So far as his story was concerned, he kept his word, entertaining
the Marquis on the journey and during their two days&rsquo; sojourn
at the humble inn at Farlingford with that flow of sympathetic and easy
conversation which always made Madame de Chantonnay protest that he
was no Englishman at all, but all that there was of the most French.&nbsp;
Has it not been seen that Colville refused to translate the dark sayings
of River Andrew by the side of the grass-grown grave, which seemed to
have been brought to the notice of the travellers by the merest accident?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised you that I should tell you nothing until you had
seen him,&rdquo; he repeated, as the Marquis followed with his eyes
the movements of the group of which the man they called Loo Barebone
formed the centre.</p>
<p>No one took much notice of the two strangers.&nbsp; It is not considered
good manners in a seafaring community to appear to notice a new-comer.&nbsp;
Captain Clubbe was naturally the object of universal attention.&nbsp;
Was he not bringing foreign money into Farlingford, where the local
purses needed replenishing now that trade had fallen away and agriculture
was so sorely hampered by the lack of roads across the marsh?</p>
<p>Clubbe pushed his way through the crowd to shake hands with the Rev.
Septimus Marvin, who seemed to emerge from a visionary world of his
own in order to perform that ceremony and to return thither on its completion.</p>
<p>Then the majority of the onlookers straggled homeward, leaving a
few wives and sweethearts waiting by the steps, with patient eyes fixed
on the spidery figures in the rigging of &ldquo;The Last Hope.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Dormer Colville and the Marquis de Gemosac were left alone, while the
rector stood a few yards away, glaring abstractedly at them through
his gold-rimmed spectacles as if they had been some strange flotsam
cast up by the high tide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Colville to his companion, &ldquo;that
I have an introduction to the pastor of the village, who, if I am not
mistaken, is even now contemplating opening a conversation.&nbsp; It
was given to me by my banker in Paris, who is a Suffolk man.&nbsp; You
remember, Marquis, John Turner, of the Rue Lafayette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; answered the Marquis, absently.&nbsp;
He was still watching the retreating villagers, with eyes old and veiled
by the trouble that they had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take this opportunity of presenting myself,&rdquo;
said Colville, who was watching the little group from the rectory without
appearing to do so.&nbsp; He rose as he spoke and went toward the clergyman,
who was probably much younger than he looked.&nbsp; For he was ill-dressed
and ill-shorn, with straggling grey hair hanging to his collar.&nbsp;
He had a musty look, such as a book may have that is laid on a shelf
in a deserted room and never opened or read.&nbsp; Septimus Marvin,
the world would say, had been laid upon a shelf when he was inducted
to the spiritual cure of Farlingford.&nbsp; But no man is ever laid
on a shelf by Fate.&nbsp; He climbs up there of his own will, and lies
down beneath the dust of forgetfulness because he lacks the heart to
arise and face the business of life.</p>
<p>Seeing that Dormer Colville was approaching him, he came forward
with a certain scholarly ease of manner as if he had once mixed with
the best on an intellectual equality.</p>
<p>Colville&rsquo;s manners were considered perfect, especially by those
who were unable to detect a fine line said to exist between ease and
too much ease.&nbsp; Mr. Marvin recollected John Turner well.&nbsp;
Ten years earlier he had, indeed, corresponded at some length with the
Paris banker respecting a valuable engraving.&nbsp; Was Mr. Colville
interested in engravings?&nbsp; Colville confessed to a deep and abiding
pleasure in this branch of art, tempered, he admitted with a laugh,
by a colossal ignorance.&nbsp; He then proceeded to give the lie to
his own modesty by talking easily and well of mezzotints and etchings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, interrupting himself with evident reluctance,
&ldquo;I am forgetting my obligations.&nbsp; Let me present to you my
companion, an old friend, the Marquis de Gemosac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two gentlemen bowed, and Mr. Marvin, knowing no French, proceeded
to address the stranger in good British Latin, after the manner of the
courtly divines of his day.&nbsp; Which Latin, from its mode of pronunciation,
was entirely unintelligible to its hearer.</p>
<p>In return, the rector introduced the two strangers to his niece,
Miriam Liston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mainstay of my quiet house,&rdquo; he added, with his
vague and dreamy smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already heard of you,&rdquo; said Dormer Colville at
once, with his modest deference, &ldquo;from my cousin, Mrs. St. Pierre
Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed, as sailors say, never to be at a loose end; but to go
through life with a facile readiness, having, as it were, his hands
full of threads among which to select, with a careless affability, one
that must draw him nearer to high and low, men and women, alike.</p>
<p>They talked together for some minutes, and, soon after the discovery
that Miriam Liston was as good a French scholar as himself, and therefore
able to converse with the Marquis de Gemosac, Colville regretted that
it was time for them to return to their simple evening meal at &ldquo;The
Black Sailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Colville to Monsieur de Gemosac, as they
walked slowly across the green toward the inn, embowered in its simple
cottage-garden, all ablaze now with hollyhocks and poppies&mdash;&ldquo;well,
after your glimpse at this man, Marquis, are you desirous to see more
of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; answered the Frenchman, with a quick gesture,
descriptive of a sudden emotion not yet stilled, &ldquo;he took my breath
away.&nbsp; I can think of nothing else.&nbsp; My poor brain is buzzing
still, and I know not what answers I made to that pretty English girl.&nbsp;
Ah!&nbsp; You smile at my enthusiasm; you do not know what it is to
have a great hope dangling before the eyes all one&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
And that face&mdash;that face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In which judgment the Marquis was no doubt right.&nbsp; For Dormer
Colville was too universal a man to be capable of concentrated zeal
upon any one object.&nbsp; He laughed at the accusation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After dinner,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I will tell you the
little story as it was told to me.&nbsp; We can sit on this seat, outside
the inn, in the scent of the flowers and smoke our cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which proposal Monsieur de Gemosac assented readily enough.&nbsp;
For he was an old man, and to such the importance of small things, such
as dinner or a passing personal comfort, are apt to be paramount.&nbsp;
Moreover, he was a remnant of that class to which France owed her downfall
among the nations; a class represented faithfully enough by its King,
Louis XVI., who procrastinated even on the steps of the guillotine.</p>
<p>The wind went down with the sun, as had been foretold by River Andrew,
and the quiet of twilight lay on the level landscape like sleep when
the two travellers returned to the seat at the inn door.&nbsp; A distant
curlew was whistling cautiously to its benighted mate, but all other
sounds were still.&nbsp; The day was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; said Colville to his companion, &ldquo;that
six months after the execution of the King, a report ran through Paris
and all France that the Dillons had succeeded in rescuing the Dauphin
from the Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was in July, 1793&mdash;just fifty-seven years ago&mdash;the
news reached me in Austria,&rdquo; answered the Marquis.</p>
<p>Colville glanced sideways at his companion, whose face was set with
a stubbornness almost worthy of the tenacious Bourbons themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Queen was alive then,&rdquo; went on the Englishman, half
diffidently, as if prepared for amendment or correction.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
had nearly three months to live.&nbsp; The separation from her children
had only just been carried out.&nbsp; She was not broken by it yet.&nbsp;
She was in full possession of her health and energy.&nbsp; She was one
of the cleverest women of that time.&nbsp; She was surrounded by men,
some of whom were frankly half-witted, others who were drunk with excess
of a sudden power for which they had had no preparation.&nbsp; Others,
again, were timorous or cunning.&nbsp; All were ignorant, and many had
received no education at all.&nbsp; For there are many ignorant people
who have been highly educated, Marquis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a short laugh and lighted a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause devoted to reflection
which appeared to be neither deep nor painful, for he smiled as he gazed
across the hazy marshes, &ldquo;mind, I am no enthusiast, as you yourself
have observed.&nbsp; I plead no cause.&nbsp; She was not my Queen, Marquis,
and France is not my country.&nbsp; I endeavour to look at the matter
with the eye of common-sense and wisdom.&nbsp; And I cannot forget that
Marie Antoinette was at bay: all her senses, all her wit alert.&nbsp;
She can only have thought of her children.&nbsp; Human nature would
dictate such thoughts.&nbsp; One cannot forget that she had devoted
friends, and that these friends possessed unlimited money.&nbsp; Do
you think, Marquis, that any one man of that rabble was above the reach&mdash;of
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mr. Dormer Colville&rsquo;s reflective smile, as he gazed at
the distant sea, would seem to indicate that, after a considerable experience
of men and women, he had reluctantly arrived at a certain conclusion
respecting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man born of woman, Marquis, is proof against bribery or
flattery&mdash;or both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can believe anything that is bad of such dregs of human-kind,
my friend,&rdquo; said Monsieur de Gemosac, contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak to one,&rdquo; continued Colville, &ldquo;who has
given the attention of a lifetime to the subject.&nbsp; If I am wrong,
correct me.&nbsp; What I have been told is that a man was found who
was ready, in return for a certain sum paid down, to substitute his
own son for the little Dauphin&mdash;to allow his son to take the chance
of coming alive out of that predicament.&nbsp; One can imagine that
such a man could be found in France at that period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur de Gemosac turned, and looked at his companion with a sort
of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as if in doubt, Monsieur Colville,&rdquo; he said,
with a sudden assumption of that grand manner with which his father
had faced the people on the Place de la R&eacute;volution&mdash;had
taken a pinch of snuff in the shadow of the guillotine one sunny July
day.&nbsp; &ldquo;You speak as if in doubt.&nbsp; Such a man was found.&nbsp;
I have spoken with him: I, who speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; THE MARQUIS&rsquo;S CREED</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Dormer Colville smiled doubtfully.&nbsp; He was too polite, it seemed,
to be sceptical, and by his attitude expressed a readiness to be convinced
as much from indifference as by reasoning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is intolerable,&rdquo; said the Marquis de Gemosac, &ldquo;that
a man of your understanding should be misled by a few romantic writers
in the pay of the Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not misled, Marquis; I am ignorant,&rdquo; laughed Colville.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not always the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur de Gemosac threw away his cigarette and turned eagerly toward
his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can convince you in
a few words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Colville leaned back against the weather-worn seat with the air
of one prepared to give a post-prandial attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a man was found as you yourself suggest.&nbsp; A boy
was found who could not refuse to run that great risk, who could not
betray himself by indiscreet speech&mdash;because he was dumb.&nbsp;
In order to allay certain rumours which were going the round of Europe,
the National Convention sent three of its members to visit the Dauphin
in prison, and they themselves have left a record that he answered none
of their questions and spoke no word to them.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because
he was dumb.&nbsp; He merely sat and looked at them solemnly, as the
dumb look.&nbsp; It was not the Dauphin at all.&nbsp; He was hidden
in the loft above.&nbsp; The visit of the Conventionals was not satisfactory.&nbsp;
The rumours were not stilled by it.&nbsp; There is nothing so elusive
or so vital as a rumour.&nbsp; Ah! you smile, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always give a careful attention to rumours,&rdquo; admitted
Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;More careful than that which one accords to official
announcements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the dumb boy was not satisfactory.&nbsp; Those who were
paid for this affair began to be alarmed.&nbsp; Not for their pockets.&nbsp;
There was plenty of money.&nbsp; Half the crowned heads in Europe, and
all the women, were ready to open their purses for the sake of a little
boy, whose ill-treatment appealed to their soft hearts: who in a sense
was sacred, for he was descended from sixty-six kings.&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
Barras and all the other scoundrels began to perceive that there was
only one way out of the difficulty into which they had blundered.&nbsp;
The Dauphin must die!&nbsp; So the dumb boy disappeared.&nbsp; One wonders
whither he went and what his fate might be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With so much to tell,&rdquo; put in Dormer Colville, musingly;
&ldquo;so much unspoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was odd how the <i>r&ocirc;les</i> had been reversed.&nbsp; For
the Marquis de Gemosac was now eagerly seeking to convince his companion.&nbsp;
The surest way to persuade a man is to lead him to persuade himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only solution was for the Dauphin to die&mdash;in public.&nbsp;
So another substitution was effected,&rdquo; continued Monsieur de Gemosac.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A dying boy from the hospital was made to play the part of the
Dauphin.&nbsp; He was not at all like him; for he was tall and dark&mdash;taller
and darker than a son of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette could ever
have been.&nbsp; The prison was reconstructed so that the sentry on
guard could not see his prisoner, but was forced to call to him in order
to make sure that he was there.&nbsp; It was a pity that he did not
resemble the Dauphin at all, this scrofulous child.&nbsp; But they were
in a hurry, and they were at their wits&rsquo; ends.&nbsp; And it is
not always easy to find a boy who will die in a given time.&nbsp; This
boy had to die, however, by some means or other.&nbsp; It was for France,
you understand, and the safety of the Great Republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hopes that he appreciated his privilege,&rdquo; observed
Colville, philosophically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he must die in public, duly certified for by persons of
undoubted integrity.&nbsp; They called in, at the last moment, Desault,
a great doctor of that day.&nbsp; But Desault was, unfortunately, honest.&nbsp;
He went home and told his assistant that this was not the Dauphin, and
that, whoever he might be, he was being poisoned.&nbsp; The assistant&rsquo;s
name was Choppart, and this Choppart made up a medicine, on Desault&rsquo;s
prescription, which was an antidote to poison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur de Gemosac paused, and, turning to his companion, held up
one finger to command his full attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desault died, my friend, four days later, and Choppart died
five days after him, and the boy in the Temple died three days after
Choppart.&nbsp; And no one knows what they died of.&nbsp; They were
pretty bunglers, those gentlemen of the Republic!&nbsp; Of course, they
called in others in a hurry; men better suited to their purpose.&nbsp;
And one of these, the citizen Pelletan, has placed on record some preposterous
lies.&nbsp; These doctors certified that this was the Dauphin.&nbsp;
They had never seen him before, but what matter?&nbsp; Great care was
taken to identify the body.&nbsp; Persons of position, who had never
seen the son of Louis XVI., were invited to visit the Temple.&nbsp;
Several of them had the temerity to protect themselves in the certificate.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We saw what we were informed was the body of the Dauphin,&rsquo;
they said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the old man turned, and held up his hand in a gesture of warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they wanted a witness whose testimony was without question&mdash;whose
word would have laid the whole question in that lost and forgotten grave
for ever&mdash;they had one in the room above.&nbsp; For the Dauphin&rsquo;s
sister was there, Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Charlotte, she who is
now Duchess of Angoul&ecirc;me.&nbsp; Why did they not bring her down
to see the body, to testify that her brother was dead and the line of
Louis XVI. ended?&nbsp; Was it chivalry?&nbsp; I ask you if these had
shown chivalry to Madame de Lamballe? to Madame Elizabeth? to Marie
Antoinette?&nbsp; Was it kindness toward a child of unparalleled misfortune?&nbsp;
I ask you if they had been kind to those whom they called the children
of the tyrant?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; They did not conduct her to that bedside,
because he who lay there was not her brother.&nbsp; Are we children,
Monsieur, to be deceived by a tale of a sudden softness of heart?&nbsp;
They wished to spare this child the pain!&nbsp; Had they ever spared
any one pain&mdash;the National Assembly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Marquis de Gemosac&rsquo;s laugh rang with a hatred which
must, it seems, outlive the possibility of revenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was to be a public funeral.&nbsp; Such a ceremony would
have been of incalculable value at that time.&nbsp; But, at the last
minute, their courage failed them.&nbsp; The boy was thrown into a forgotten
corner of a Paris churchyard, at nine o&rsquo;clock one night, without
witnesses.&nbsp; The spot itself cannot now be identified.&nbsp; Do
you tell me that that was the Dauphin?&nbsp; Bah! my friend, the thing
was too childish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ignorant and the unlettered,&rdquo; observed Colville,
with the air of making a concession, &ldquo;are always at a disadvantage&mdash;even
in crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the Dauphin was, in the mean time, concealed in the garret
of the Tower appears to be certain.&nbsp; That he was finally conveyed
out of the prison in a clothes-basket is as certain, Monsieur, as it
is certain that the sun will rise to-morrow.&nbsp; And I believe that
the Queen knew, when she went to the guillotine, that her son was no
longer in the Temple.&nbsp; I believe that Heaven sent her that one
scrap of comfort, tempered as it was by the knowledge that her daughter
remained a prisoner in their hands.&nbsp; But it was to her son that
her affections were given.&nbsp; For the Duchess never had the gift
of winning love.&nbsp; As she is now&mdash;a cold, hard, composed woman&mdash;so
she was in her prison in the Temple at the age of fifteen.&nbsp; You
may take it from one who has known her all his life.&nbsp; And from
that moment to this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis paused, and made a gesture with his hands, descriptive
of space and the unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that moment to this&mdash;nothing.&nbsp; Nothing of the
Dauphin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned in his seat and looked questioningly up toward the crumbling
church, with its square tower, stricken, years ago, by lightning; with
its grass-grown graveyard marked by stones all grey and hoary with immense
age and the passage of cold and stormy winters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what may have become of
him?&nbsp; Who can say where he lies?&nbsp; For a life begun as his
began was not likely to be a long one.&nbsp; Though troubles do not
kill.&nbsp; Witness myself, who am five years his senior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville looked at him in obedience to an inviting gesture of the
hand; looked as at something he did not understand, something beyond
his understanding, perhaps.&nbsp; For the troubles had not been Monsieur
de Gemosac&rsquo;s own troubles, but those of his country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Duchess?&rdquo; said the Englishman at length, after
a pause, &ldquo;at Frohsdorf&mdash;what does she say&mdash;or think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says nothing,&rdquo; replied the Marquis de Gemosac, sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is silent, because the world is listening for every word
she may utter.&nbsp; What she thinks . . . . Ah! who knows?&nbsp; She
is an old woman, my friend, for she is seventy-one.&nbsp; Her memories
are a millstone about her neck.&nbsp; No wonder she is silent.&nbsp;
Think what her life has been.&nbsp; As a child, three years of semi-captivity
at the Tuileries, with the mob howling round the railings.&nbsp; Three
and a half years a prisoner in the Temple.&nbsp; Both parents sent to
the guillotine&mdash;her aunt to the same.&nbsp; All her world&mdash;massacred.&nbsp;
As a girl, she was collected, majestic; or else she could not have survived
those years in the Temple, alone&mdash;the last of her family.&nbsp;
What must her thoughts have been, at night in her prison?&nbsp; As a
woman, she is cold, sad, unemotional.&nbsp; No one ever lived through
such troubles with so little display of feeling.&nbsp; The Restoration,
the Hundred Days, the second Restoration, Louis XVIII., and his flight
to England; Charles X. and his abdication; her own husband, the Duc
d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me&mdash;the Dauphin for many years, the King for
half an hour&mdash;these are some of her experiences.&nbsp; She has
lived for forty years in exile in Mittau, Memel, Warsaw, K&ouml;nigsberg,
Prague, England; and now she is at Frohsdorf, awaiting the end.&nbsp;
You ask me what she says?&nbsp; She says nothing, but she knows&mdash;she
has always known&mdash;that her brother did not die in the Temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; suggested Colville, who certainly had acquired
the French art of putting much meaning into one word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not seek him? you would ask.&nbsp; How do you know
that she has not done so, my friend, with tears?&nbsp; But as years
passed on, and brought no word of him, it became less and less desirable.&nbsp;
While Louis XVIII. continued to reign there was no reason to wish to
find Louis XVII., you understand.&nbsp; For there was still a Bourbon,
of the direct line, upon the throne.&nbsp; Louis XVIII. would scarcely
desire it.&nbsp; One would not expect him to seek very diligently for
one who would deprive him of the crown.&nbsp; Charles X., knowing he
must succeed his brother, was no more enthusiastic in the search.&nbsp;
And the Duchess d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me herself, you ask?&nbsp; I can
see the question in your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; conceded Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;For, after all,
he was her brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and if she found him, what would be the result?&nbsp;
Her uncle would be driven from the throne; her father-in-law would not
inherit; her own husband, the Dauphin, would be Dauphin no longer.&nbsp;
She herself could never be Queen of France.&nbsp; It is a hard thing
to say of a woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur de Gemosac paused for a moment in reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;a hard thing.&nbsp;
But this is a hard world, Monsieur Colville, and will not allow either
men or women to be angels.&nbsp; I have known and served the Duchess
all my life, and I confess that she has never lost sight of the fact
that, should Louis XVII. be found, she herself would never be Queen
of France.&nbsp; One is not a Bourbon for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is not a stateswoman and a daughter of kings for nothing,&rdquo;
amended Colville, with his tolerant laugh; for he was always ready to
make allowances.&nbsp; &ldquo;Better, perhaps, that France should be
left quiet, under the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> she had accepted, than disturbed
by the offer of another <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, which might be less acceptable.&nbsp;
You always remind me&mdash;you, who deal with France&mdash;of a lion-tamer
at a circus.&nbsp; You have a very slight control over your performing
beasts.&nbsp; If they refuse to do the trick you propose, you do not
press it, but pass on to another trick; and the bars of the cage always
appear to the onlooker to be very inadequate.&nbsp; Perhaps it was better,
Marquis, to let the Dauphin go; to pass him over, and proceed to the
tricks suitable to the momentary humour of your wild animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac gave a curt laugh, which thrilled with a note
of that fearful joy known to those who seek to control the uncontrollable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that time,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;it might be so.&nbsp;
But not now.&nbsp; At that time there lived Louis XVIII. and Charles
X., and his sons, the Duc d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me and the Duc de Berri,
who might reasonably be expected to have sons in their turn.&nbsp; There
were plenty of Bourbons, it seemed.&nbsp; And now&mdash;where are they?&nbsp;
What is left of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a nod of the head toward the sea that lay between him and
Germany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One old woman, over there, at Frohsdorf, the daughter of Marie
Antoinette, awaiting the end of her bitter pilgrimage&mdash;and this
Comte de Chambord.&nbsp; This man who will not when he may.&nbsp; No,
my friend, it has never been so necessary to find Louis XVII. as it
is now.&nbsp; Necessary for France&mdash;for the whole world.&nbsp;
This Prince President, this last offshoot of a pernicious republican
growth, will drag us all in the mud if he gets his way with France.&nbsp;
And those who have watched with seeing eyes have always known that such
a time as the present must eventually come.&nbsp; For France will always
be the victim of a clever adventurer.&nbsp; We have foreseen it, and
for that reason we have treated as serious possibilities these false
Dauphins who have sprung up like mushrooms all over Europe and even
in America.&nbsp; And what have they proved?&nbsp; What have the Bourbons
proved in frustrating their frauds?&nbsp; That the son of Louis XVI.
did not die in the Temple.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; And Madame herself
has gathered further strength to her conviction that the little King
was not buried in that forgotten corner of the graveyard of Sainte Margu&eacute;rite.&nbsp;
At the same time, she knows that none of these&mdash;neither Naundorff,
nor Havergault, nor Bruneau, nor de Richemont, nor any other pretender&mdash;was
her brother.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; The King, either because he did not know
he was King, or because he had had enough of royalty, never came forward
and never betrayed his whereabouts.&nbsp; He was to be sought; he is
still to be sought.&nbsp; And it is now that he is wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why I offer to tell you this story now.&nbsp; That
is my reason for bringing you to Farlingford now,&rdquo; said Colville,
quietly.&nbsp; It seemed that he must have awaited, as the wise do in
this world, the propitious moment, and should it never come they are
content to forego their purpose.&nbsp; He gave a light laugh and stretched
out his long legs, contemplating his strapped trousers and neat boots
with the eye of a connoisseur.&nbsp; &ldquo;And should I be the humble
means of doing a good turn to France and others, will France&mdash;and
others&mdash;remember it, I wonder.&nbsp; Perhaps I hold in my hands
the Hope of France, Marquis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and lapsed for a moment into thought.&nbsp; It was eight
o&rsquo;clock, and the long northern twilight was fading into darkness
now.&nbsp; The bell of Captain Clubbe&rsquo;s ship rang out the hour&mdash;a
new sound in the stillness of this forgotten town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Last Hope,&rdquo; added Dormer Colville, with a queer
laugh.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; ON THE DYKE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Neither had spoken again when their thoughts were turned aside from
that story which Colville, instead of telling, had been called upon
to hear.</p>
<p>For the man whose story it presumably was passed across the green
ere the sound of the ship&rsquo;s bell had died away.&nbsp; He had changed
his clothes, or else it would have appeared that he was returning to
his ship.&nbsp; He walked with his head thrown up, with long lithe steps,
with a gait and carriage so unlike the heavy tread of men wearing sea-boots
all their working days, that none would have believed him to be born
and bred in Farlingford.&nbsp; For it is not only in books that history
is written, but in the turn of a head, in the sound of a voice, in the
vague and dreamy thoughts half formulated by the human mind &rsquo;twixt
sleeping and waking.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Gemosac paused, with his cigarette held poised halfway
to his lips, and watched the man go past, while Dormer Colville, leaning
back against the wall, scanned him sideways between lowered lids.</p>
<p>It would seem that Barebone must have an appointment.&nbsp; He walked
without looking about him, like one who is late.&nbsp; He rather avoided
than sought the greeting of a friend from the open cottage-doors as
he passed on.&nbsp; On reaching the quay he turned quickly to the left,
following the path that led toward the dyke at the riverside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is no sailor at heart,&rdquo; commented Colville.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He never even glanced at his ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet it was he who steered the ship in that dangerous river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be skilful in anything he undertakes,&rdquo; suggested
Colville, in explanation.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is Captain Clubbe who will
tell us that.&nbsp; For Captain Clubbe has known him since his birth,
and was the friend of his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat in silence watching the shadowy figure on the dyke, outlined
dimly against the hazy horizon.&nbsp; He was walking, still with haste
as if to a certain destination, toward the rectory buried in its half
circle of crouching trees.&nbsp; And already another shadow was hurrying
from the house to meet him.&nbsp; It was the boy, little Sep Marvin,
and in the stillness of the evening his shrill voice could be heard
in excited greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you brought?&nbsp; What have you brought?&rdquo;
he was crying, as he ran toward Barebone.&nbsp; They seemed to have
so much to say to each other that they could not wait until they came
within speaking distance.&nbsp; The boy took Barebone&rsquo;s hand,
and turning walked back with him to the old house peeping over the dyke
toward the sea.&nbsp; He could scarcely walk quietly, for joy at the
return of his friend, and skipped from side to side, pouring out questions
and answering them himself as children and women do.</p>
<p>But Barebone gave him only half of his attention and looked before
him with grave eyes, while the boy talked of nests and knives.&nbsp;
Barebone was looking toward the garden, concealed like an intrenchment
behind the dyke.&nbsp; It was a quiet evening, and the rector was walking
slowly backward and forward on the raised path, made on the dyke itself,
like a ship-captain on his quarter-deck, with hands clasped behind his
bent back and eyes that swept the horizon at each turn with a mechanical
monotony.&nbsp; At one end of the path, which was worn smooth by the
Reverend Septimus Marvin&rsquo;s pensive foot, the gleam of a white
dress betrayed the presence of his niece, Miriam Liston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, is that you?&rdquo; asked the rector, holding out a limp
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I remember Sep was allowed to sit up till
half-past eight in the hope that you might come round to see us.&nbsp;
Well, Loo, and how are you?&nbsp; Yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he looked vaguely out to sea, repeating below his breath the
words &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&rdquo; almost in a whisper, as if communing
secretly with his own thoughts out of hearing of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I should come round to see you,&rdquo; answered
Barebone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where else should I go?&nbsp; So soon as we had
had tea and I could change my clothes and get away from that dear Mrs.
Clubbe.&nbsp; It seems so strange to come back here from the racketing
world&mdash;and France is a racketing world of its own&mdash;and find
everything in Farlingford just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had shaken hands with the rector and with Miriam Liston as he
spoke, and his speech was not the speech of Farlingford men at all,
but rather of Septimus Marvin himself, of whose voice he had acquired
the ring of education, while adding to it a neatness and quickness of
enunciation which must have been his own; for none in Suffolk could
have taught it to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; he repeated, glancing at the book Miriam
had laid aside for a moment to greet him and had now taken up again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That book must be very large print,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
you to be able to read by this light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is large print,&rdquo; answered the girl, with a friendly
laugh, as she returned to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are still resolved to be a sailor?&rdquo; inquired
Marvin, looking at him with kind eyes for ever asleep, it would appear,
in some long slumber which must have been the death of one of the sources
of human energy&mdash;of ambition or of hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until I find a better calling,&rdquo; answered Loo Barebone,
with his eager laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I am away I wonder how any can
be content to live in Farlingford and let the world go by.&nbsp; And
when I am here I wonder how any can be so foolish as to fret and fume
in the restless world while he might be sitting quietly at Farlingford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured the rector, musingly, &ldquo;you are for
the world.&nbsp; You, with your capacities, your quickness for learning,
your&mdash;well, your lightness of heart, my dear Loo.&nbsp; That goes
far in the great world.&nbsp; To be light of heart&mdash;to amuse.&nbsp;
Yes, you are for the world.&nbsp; You might do something there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing in Farlingford?&rdquo; inquired Barebone, gaily;
but he turned, as he spoke, and glanced once more at Miriam Liston as
if in some dim way the question could not be answered by any other.&nbsp;
She was absorbed in her book again.&nbsp; The print must indeed have
been large and clear, for the twilight was fading fast.</p>
<p>She looked up and met his glance with direct and steady eyes of a
clear grey.&nbsp; A severe critic of that which none can satisfactorily
define&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s beauty&mdash;would have objected that her
face was too wide, and her chin too square.&nbsp; Her hair, which was
of a bright brown, grew with a singular strength and crispness round
a brow which was serene and square.&nbsp; In her eyes there shone the
light of tenacity, and a steady purpose.&nbsp; A student of human nature
must have regretted that the soul looking out of such eyes should have
been vouchsafed to a woman.&nbsp; For strength and purpose in a man
are usually exercised for the good of mankind, while in a woman such
qualities must, it would seem, benefit no more than one man of her own
generation, and a few who may follow her in the next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; she said, turning to her book again,
&ldquo;for a man to do in Farlingford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for a woman&mdash;?&rdquo; inquired Barebone, without
looking at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always something&mdash;everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Septimus Marvin&rsquo;s reflective &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo;
as he paused in his walk and looked seaward, came in appropriately as
a grave confirmation of Miriam&rsquo;s jesting statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he repeated, turning toward Barebone,
who stood listening to the boy&rsquo;s chatter.&nbsp; &ldquo;You find
us as you left us, Loo.&nbsp; Was it six months ago?&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp;
How time flies when one remains stationary.&nbsp; For you, I dare say,
it seems more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me&mdash;oh yes, it seems more,&rdquo; replied Barebone,
with his gay laugh, and a glance toward Miriam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little older,&rdquo; continued the rector.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
church a little mouldier.&nbsp; Farlingford a little emptier.&nbsp;
Old Godbold is gone&mdash;the last of the Godbolds of Farlingford, which
means another empty cottage in the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it as I came down,&rdquo; answered Barebone.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
look like last year&rsquo;s nests&mdash;those empty cottages.&nbsp;
But you have been all well, here at the rectory, since we sailed?&nbsp;
The cottages&mdash;well, they are only cottages after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miriam&rsquo;s eyes were raised for a moment from her book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it like that they talk in France?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are those the sentiments of the great republic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I could make you look up from your book,&rdquo;
he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;One has merely to cast a slur upon the poor&mdash;your
dear poor of Farlingford&mdash;and you are up in arms in an instant.&nbsp;
But I am not the person to cast a slur, since I am one of the poor of
Farlingford myself, and owe it to charity&mdash;to the charity of the
rectory&mdash;that I can read and write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it came to you very naturally,&rdquo; observed Marvin,
looking vaguely across the marshes to the roofs of the village, &ldquo;to
suggest that those who live in cottages are of a different race of beings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, following his own thoughts in silence, as men soon
learn to do who have had no companion by them capable of following whithersoever
they may lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it?&rdquo; asked Barebone, sharply.&nbsp; He turned to
look at his old friend and mentor with a sudden quick distress.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope not.&nbsp; I hope it did not sound like that.&nbsp; For
you have never taught me such thoughts, have you?&nbsp; Quite the contrary.&nbsp;
And I cannot have learned it from Clubbe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off with a laugh of relief, for he had perceived that Septimus
Marvin&rsquo;s thoughts were already elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; he added, turning to Miriam.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It may be that one should go to a republic in order to learn&mdash;once
for all&mdash;that all men are not equal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say it with so much conviction,&rdquo; was the retort,
&ldquo;that you must have known it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do not know it.&nbsp; I deny such knowledge.&nbsp; Where
could I have learned such a principle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spread out his arms in emphatic denial.&nbsp; For he was quick
in all his gestures&mdash;quick to laugh or be grave&mdash;quick, with
the rapidity of a woman to catch a thought held back by silence or concealed
in speech.</p>
<p>Marvin merely looked at him with a dreamy smile and lapsed again
into those speculations which filled his waking moments; for the business
of life never received his full attention.&nbsp; He contemplated the
world from afar off, and was like that blind man at Bethsaida who saw
men as trees walking, and rubbed his eyes and wondered.&nbsp; He turned
at the sound of the church clock and looked at his son, whose attitude
towards Barebone was that of an admiring younger brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sep,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your extra half-hour has passed.&nbsp;
You will have time to-morrow and for many days to come to exchange views
with Loo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was old before his time, as the children of elderly parents
always are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, with a grave nod.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
you must not tell Loo where those young herons are after I am gone to
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went slowly toward the house, looking back suspiciously from time
to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herons? no.&nbsp; Why should I?&nbsp; Where are they?&rdquo;
muttered Mr. Marvin, vaguely, and he absent-mindedly followed his son,
leaving Miriam Liston sitting in the turf shelter, built like an embrasure
in the dyke, and Barebone standing a little distance from her, looking
at her.</p>
<p>A silence fell upon them&mdash;the silence that follows the departure
of a third person when those who are left behind turn a new page.&nbsp;
Miriam laid her book upon her lap and looked across the river now slowly
turning to its ebb.&nbsp; She did not look at Barebone, but her eyes
were conscious of his proximity.&nbsp; Her attitude, like his, seemed
to indicate the knowledge that this moment had been inevitable from
the first, and that there was no desire on either part to avoid it or
to hasten its advent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a haunting fear as we came up the river,&rdquo; he said
at length, quietly and with an odd courtesy of manner, &ldquo;that you
might have gone away.&nbsp; That is the calamity always hanging over
this quiet house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with the ease of manner which always indicates a long friendship,
or a close <i>camaraderie</i>, resulting from common interests or a
common endeavour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I go away?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand, why should you stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I fancy I am wanted,&rdquo; she replied, in the lighter
tone which he had used.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is gratifying to one&rsquo;s
vanity, you know, whether it be true or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is true enough.&nbsp; One cannot imagine what they
would do without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was watching Septimus Marvin as he spoke.&nbsp; Sep had joined
him and was walking gravely by his side toward the house.&nbsp; They
were ill-assorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is a limit even to self-sacrifice and&mdash;well,
there is another world open to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a curt laugh as if he had touched a topic upon which they
would disagree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I leave myself
open to a <i>tu quoque</i>, I know.&nbsp; There are other worlds open
to me also, you would say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her with his gay and easy smile; but she made no answer,
and her resolute lips closed together sharply.&nbsp; The subject had
been closed by some past conversation or incident which had left a memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are those two men staying at &lsquo;The Black Sailor&rsquo;&rdquo;,
she asked, changing the subject, or only turning into a by-way, perhaps.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You saw them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to take it for granted that he should have seen them,
though he had not appeared to look in their direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes.&nbsp; I saw them, but I do not know who they
are.&nbsp; I came straight here as soon as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them is a Frenchman,&rdquo; she said, taking no heed
of the excuse given for his ignorance of Farlingford news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man&mdash;I thought so.&nbsp; I felt it when I looked
at him.&nbsp; It was perhaps a fellow feeling.&nbsp; I suppose I am
a Frenchman after all.&nbsp; Clubbe always says I am one when I am at
the wheel and let the ship go off the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miriam was looking along the dyke, peering into the gathering darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them is coming toward us now,&rdquo; she said, almost
warningly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not the Marquis de Gemosac, but the other&mdash;the
Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound him,&rdquo; muttered Barebone.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
does he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to judge from Mr. Dormer Colville&rsquo;s pace it would appear
that he chiefly desired to interrupt their <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; THE STORY OF THE CASTAWAYS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When River Andrew stated that there were few at Farlingford who knew
more of Frenchman than himself, it is to be presumed that he spoke by
the letter, and under the reserve that Captain Clubbe was not at the
moment on shore.</p>
<p>For Captain Clubbe had known Frenchman since boyhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Dormer Colville to him two or three
days after the arrival of &ldquo;The Last Hope,&rdquo; &ldquo;that the
Marquis de Gemosac cannot do better than apply to you for some information
he desires to possess.&nbsp; In fact, it is on that account that we
are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The introduction had been a matter requiring patience.&nbsp; For
Captain Clubbe had not laid aside in his travels a certain East Anglian
distrust of the unknown.&nbsp; He had, of course, noted the presence
of the strangers when he landed at Farlingford quay, but his large,
immobile face had betrayed no peculiar interest.&nbsp; There had been
plenty to tell him all that was known of Monsieur de Gemosac and Dormer
Colville, and a good deal that was only surmised.&nbsp; But the imagination
of even the darksome River Andrew failed to soar successfully under
the measuring blue eye, and the total lack of comment of Captain Clubbe.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, little to tell, although the strangers had been
seen to go to the rectory in quite a friendly way, and had taken a glass
of sherry in the rector&rsquo;s study.&nbsp; Mrs. Clacy was responsible
for this piece of news, and her profession giving her the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>
to almost every back door in Farlingford enabled her to gather news
at the fountain-head.&nbsp; For Mrs. Clacy went out to oblige.&nbsp;
She obliged the rectory on Mondays, and Mrs. Clubbe, with what was technically
described as the heavy wash, on Tuesdays.&nbsp; Whatever Mrs. Clacy
was asked to do she could perform with a rough efficiency.&nbsp; But
she always undertook it with reluctance.&nbsp; It was not, she took
care to mention, what she was accustomed to, but she would do it to
oblige.&nbsp; Her charge was eighteen-pence a day with her dinner, and
(she made the addition with a raised eyebrow, and the resigned sigh
of one who takes her meals as a duty toward those dependent on her)
a bit of tea at the end of the day.</p>
<p>It was on a Wednesday that Dormer Colville met Captain Clubbe face
to face in the street, and was forced to curb his friendly smile and
half-formed nod of salutation.&nbsp; For Captain Clubbe went past him
with a rigid face and steadily averted eyes, like a walking monument.&nbsp;
For there was something in the captain&rsquo;s deportment dimly suggestive
of stone, and the dignity of stillness.&nbsp; His face meant security,
his large limbs a slow, sure action.</p>
<p>Colville and Monsieur de Gemosac were on the quay in the afternoon
at high tide when &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; was warped on to the slip-way.&nbsp;
All Farlingford was there too, and Captain Clubbe carried out the difficult
task with hardly any words at all from a corner of the jetty, with Loo
Barebone on board as second in command.</p>
<p>Captain Clubbe could not fail to perceive the strangers, for they
stood a few yards from him, Monsieur de Gemosac peering with his yellow
eyes toward the deck of &ldquo;The Last Hope,&rdquo; where Barebone
stood on the forecastle giving the orders transmitted to him by a sign
from his taciturn captain.&nbsp; Colville seemed to take a greater interest
in the proceedings, and noted the skill and precision of the crew with
the air of a seaman.</p>
<p>Presently, Septimus Marvin wandered down the dyke and stood irresolutely
at the far corner of the jetty.&nbsp; He always approached his flock
with diffidence, although they treated him kindly enough, much as they
treated such of their own children as were handicapped in the race of
life by some malformation or mental incapacity.</p>
<p>Colville approached him and they stood side by side until &ldquo;The
Last Hope&rdquo; was safely moored and chocked.&nbsp; Then it was that
the rector introduced the two strangers to Captain Clubbe.&nbsp; It
being a Wednesday, Clubbe must have known all that there was to know,
and more, of Monsieur de Gemosac and Dormer Colville; for Mrs. Clacy,
it will be remembered, obliged Mrs. Clubbe on Tuesdays.&nbsp; Nothing,
however, in the mask-like face, large and square, of the ship-captain
indicated that he knew aught of his new acquaintances, or desired to
know more.&nbsp; And when Colville frankly explained their presence
in Farlingford, Captain Clubbe nodded gravely and that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can wait, however, until a more suitable opportunity presents
itself,&rdquo; Colville hastened to add.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are busy,
as even a landsman can perceive, and cannot be expected to think of
anything but your vessel until the tide leaves her high and dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and explained the situation to the Marquis, who shrugged
his shoulders impatiently as if at the delay.&nbsp; For he was a southerner,
and was, perhaps, ignorant of the fact that in dealing with any born
on the shores of the German Ocean nothing is gained and, more often
than not, all is lost by haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear,&rdquo; Colville added, turning to the Captain, and
speaking in a curter manner; for so strongly was he moved by that human
kindness which is vaguely called sympathy that his speech varied according
to his listener.&nbsp; &ldquo;You hear the Marquis only speaks French.&nbsp;
It is about a fellow countryman of his buried here.&nbsp; Drop in and
have a glass of wine with us some evening; to-night, if you are at liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I can tell you won&rsquo;t take long,&rdquo; said Clubbe,
over his shoulder; for the tide was turning, and in a few minutes would
be ebbing fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare say not.&nbsp; But we have a good bin of claret at &lsquo;The
Black Sailor,&rsquo; and shall be glad of your opinion on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubbe nodded, with a curt laugh, which might have been intended
to deprecate the possession of any opinion on a vintage, or to express
his disbelief that Dormer Colville desired to have it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his large person loomed in the dusk of the trees soon
after sunset, in the narrow road leading from his house to the church
and the green.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Gemosac and his companion were sitting on the bench outside
the inn, leaning against the sill of their own parlour-window, which
stood open.&nbsp; The Captain had changed his clothes, and now wore
those in which he went to church and to the custom-house when in London
or other large cities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There walks a just man,&rdquo; commented Dormer Colville,
lightly, and no longer word could have described Captain Clubbe more
aptly.&nbsp; He would rather have stayed in his own garden this evening
to smoke his pipe in contemplative silence.&nbsp; But he had always
foreseen that the day might come when it would be his duty to do his
best by Loo Barebone.&nbsp; He had not sought this opportunity, because,
being a wise as well as a just man, he was not quite sure that he knew
what the best would be.</p>
<p>He shook hands gravely with the strangers, and by his manner seemed
to indicate his comprehension of Monsieur de Gemosac&rsquo;s well-turned
phrases of welcome.&nbsp; Dormer Colville appeared to be in a silent
humour, unless perchance he happened to be one of those rare beings
who can either talk or hold their tongues as occasion may demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t want me to put my oar in, I see,&rdquo; observed
he, tentatively, as he drew forward a small table whereon were set three
glasses and a bottle of the celebrated claret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand French, but I don&rsquo;t talk it,&rdquo;
replied the Captain, stolidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I interpret as we go along, we shall sit here all night,
and get very little said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville explained the difficulty to the Marquis de Gemosac, and
agreed with him that much time would be saved if Captain Clubbe would
be kind enough to tell in English all that he knew of the nameless Frenchman
buried in Farlingford churchyard, to be translated by Colville to Monsieur
de Gemosac at another time.&nbsp; As Clubbe understood this, and nodded
in acquiescence, there only remained to them to draw the cork and light
their cigars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much to tell,&rdquo; said Clubbe, guardedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
what there is, is no secret, so far as I know.&nbsp; It has not been
told because it was known long ago, and has been forgotten since.&nbsp;
The man&rsquo;s dead and buried, and there&rsquo;s an end of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of him, yes, but not of his race,&rdquo; answered Colville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the lad?&rdquo; inquired the Captain, turning his
calm and steady gaze to Colville&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The whole man seemed
to turn, ponderously and steadily, like a siege-gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I meant,&rdquo; answered Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
understand,&rdquo; he went on to explain, as if urged thereto by the
fixed glance of the clear blue eye&mdash;&ldquo;you understand, it is
none of my business.&nbsp; I am only here as the Marquis de Gemosac&rsquo;s
friend.&nbsp; Know him in his own country, where I live most of the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubbe nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frenchman was picked up at sea fifty-five years ago this July,&rdquo;
he narrated, bluntly, &ldquo;by the &lsquo;Martha and Mary&rsquo; brig
of this port.&nbsp; I was apprentice at the time.&nbsp; Frenchman was
a boy with fair hair and a womanish face.&nbsp; Bit of a cry-baby I
used to think him, but being a boy myself I was perhaps hard on him.&nbsp;
He was with his&mdash;well, his mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Clubbe paused.&nbsp; He took the cigar from his lips and
carefully replaced the outer leaf, which had wrinkled.&nbsp; Perhaps
he waited to be asked a question.&nbsp; Colville glanced at him sideways
and did not ask it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark night,&rdquo; the Captain continued, after a short silence,
&ldquo;and a heavy sea, about mid-channel off Dieppe.&nbsp; We sighted
a French fishing-boat yawing about abandoned.&nbsp; Something queer
about her, the skipper thought.&nbsp; Those were queer times in France.&nbsp;
We hailed her, and getting no answer put out a boat and boarded her.&nbsp;
There was nobody on board but a woman and a child.&nbsp; Woman was half
mad with fear.&nbsp; I have seen many afraid, but never one like that.&nbsp;
I was only a boy myself, but I remember thinking it wasn&rsquo;t the
sea and drowning she was afraid of.&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t find out
the smack&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; It had been painted out with a tar-brush,
and she was half full of water.&nbsp; The skipper took the woman and
child off, and left the fishing-smack as we found her yawing about&mdash;all
sail set.&nbsp; They reckoned she would founder in a few minutes.&nbsp;
But there was one old man on board, the boatswain, who had seen many
years at sea, who said that she wasn&rsquo;t making any water at all,
because he had been told to look for the leak and couldn&rsquo;t find
it.&nbsp; He said that the water had been pumped into her so as to waterlog
her; and it was his belief that she had not been abandoned many minutes,
that the crew were hanging about somewhere near in a boat waiting to
see if we sighted her and put men on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Dormer Colville was attending to the claret, and pressed Captain
Clubbe by a gesture of the hand to empty his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something wrong somewhere?&rdquo; he suggested, in a conversational
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By daylight we were ramping up channel with three French men-of-war
after us,&rdquo; was Captain Clubbe&rsquo;s comprehensive reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As chance had it, the channel squadron hove in sight round the
Foreland, and the Frenchmen turned and left us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubbe marked a pause in his narrative by a glass of claret taken
at one draught like beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skipper was a Farlingford man, name of Doy,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Long as he lived he was pestered by inquiries from the French
government respecting a Dieppe fishing-smack supposed to have been picked
up abandoned at sea.&nbsp; He had picked up no fishing-smack, and he
answered no letters about it.&nbsp; He was an old man when it happened,
and he died at sea soon after my indentures expired.&nbsp; The woman
and child were brought here, where nobody could speak French, and, of
course, neither of them could speak any English.&nbsp; The boy was white-faced
and frightened at first, but he soon picked up spirit.&nbsp; They were
taken in and cared for by one and another&mdash;any who could afford
it.&nbsp; For Farlingford has always bred seafaring men ready to give
and take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we were told yesterday by the rector.&nbsp; We had a long
talk with him in the morning.&nbsp; A clever man, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dormer Colville did not complete the remark, but broke off with a
sigh.&nbsp; He had no doubt seen trouble himself.&nbsp; For it is not
always the ragged and unkempt who have been sore buffeted by the world,
but also such as have a clean-washed look almost touching sleekness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clubbe, slowly and conclusively.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
you have seen the parson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Colville remarked, cheerfully, after a pause;
for we cannot always be commiserating the unfortunate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course, all this happened before his time, and Monsieur de Gemosac does
not want to learn from hearsay, you understand, but at first hand.&nbsp;
I fancy he would, for instance, like to know when the woman, the&mdash;mother
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubbe was looking straight in front of him.&nbsp; He turned in his
disconcerting, monumental way and looked at his questioner, who had
imitated with a perfect ingenuousness his own brief pause before the
word mother.&nbsp; Colville smiled pleasantly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you frankly, Captain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would
suit me better if she wasn&rsquo;t the mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not here to suit you,&rdquo; murmured Captain Clubbe,
without haste or hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Well, let us say for the present that she was the
mother.&nbsp; We can discuss that another time.&nbsp; When did she die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven years after landing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville made a mental calculation and nodded his head with satisfaction
at the end of it.&nbsp; He lighted another cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a business man, Captain,&rdquo; he said at length.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fair dealing and a clean bond.&nbsp; That is what I have been
brought up to.&nbsp; Confidence for confidence.&nbsp; Before we go any
further&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused and seemed to think before committing
himself.&nbsp; Perhaps he saw that Captain Clubbe did not intend to
go much further without some <i>quid pro quo</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before
we go any further, I think I may take it upon myself to let you into
the Marquis&rsquo;s confidence.&nbsp; It is about an inheritance, Captain.&nbsp;
A great inheritance and&mdash;well, that young fellow may well be the
man.&nbsp; He may be born to greater things than a seafaring life, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any marquis to tell me that,&rdquo; answered
Clubbe, with his slow judicial smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I&rsquo;ve brought
him up since the cradle.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been at sea with me in fair
weather and foul&mdash;and he is not the same as us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; ON THE SCENT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Dormer Colville attached so much importance to the captain&rsquo;s
grave jest that he interpreted it at once to Monsieur de Gemosac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Clubbe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tells us that he does
not need to be informed that this Loo Barebone is the man we seek.&nbsp;
He has long known it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was a near enough rendering, perhaps, to pass muster in the
hearing of two persons imperfectly acquainted with the languages so
translated.&nbsp; Then, turning again to the sailor, he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur de Gemosac would naturally wish to know whether there
were papers or any other means of identification found on the woman
or the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were a few papers.&nbsp; The woman had a Roman Catholic
Missal in her pocket, and the child a small locket with a miniature
portrait in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the Queen Marie Antoinette?&rdquo; suggested Colville,
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may well have been.&nbsp; It is many years since I saw
it.&nbsp; It was faded enough.&nbsp; I remember that it had a fall,
and would not open afterward.&nbsp; No one has seen it for twenty-five
years or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The locket or the portrait?&rdquo; inquired Colville, with
a light laugh, with which to disclaim any suggestion of a cross-examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The portrait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the locket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife has it somewhere, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville gave an impatient laugh.&nbsp; For the peaceful air of Farlingford
had failed to temper that spirit of energy and enterprise which he had
acquired in cities&mdash;in Paris, most likely.&nbsp; He had no tolerance
for quiet ways and a slow, sure progress, such as countrymen seek, who
are so leisurely that the years slide past and death surprises them
before they have done anything in the world but attend to its daily
demand for a passing effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but all that must be looked into
if we are to do anything for this young fellow.&nbsp; You will find
the Marquis anxious to be up and doing at once.&nbsp; You go so slowly
in Farlingford, Captain.&nbsp; The world is hurrying on and this chance
will be gone past before we are ready.&nbsp; Let us get these small
proofs of identity collected together as soon as possible.&nbsp; Let
us find that locket.&nbsp; But do not force it open.&nbsp; Give it to
me as it is.&nbsp; Let us find the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no papers,&rdquo; interrupted Captain Clubbe, with
a calm deliberation quite untouched by his companion&rsquo;s hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; for Frenchman burnt them before my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dormer Colville meditated for a moment in silence.&nbsp; Although
his manner was quick, he was perhaps as deliberate in his choice of
a question as was Captain Clubbe in answering it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he do that?&nbsp; Did he know who he was?&nbsp; Did
he ever say anything to you about his former life&mdash;his childhood&mdash;his
recollections of France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not a man to say much,&rdquo; answered Clubbe, himself
no man to repeat much.</p>
<p>Colville had been trying for some time to study the sailor&rsquo;s
face, quietly through his cigar smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Captain,&rdquo; he said, after a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
us understand each other.&nbsp; There is a chance, just a chance, that
we can prove this Loo Barebone to be the man we think him, but we must
all stand together.&nbsp; We must be of one mind and one purpose.&nbsp;
We four, Monsieur de Gemosac, you, Barebone, and my humble self.&nbsp;
I fancy&mdash;well, I fancy it may prove to be worth our while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing to do the best I can for Loo,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am willing to do the best I can for Monsieur de Gemosac,
whose heart is set on this affair.&nbsp; And,&rdquo; Colville added,
with his frank laugh, &ldquo;let us hope that we may have our reward;
for I am a poor man myself, and do not like the prospect of a careful
old age.&nbsp; I suppose, Captain, that if a man were overburdened with
wealth he would scarcely follow a seafaring life, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is money in it?&rdquo; inquired Clubbe, guardedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money,&rdquo; laughed the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes&mdash;there
is money for all concerned, and to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Clubbe had been born and bred among a people possessing little
wealth and leading a hard life, only to come to want in old age.&nbsp;
It was natural that this consideration should carry weight.&nbsp; He
was anxious to do his best for the boy who had been brought up as his
own son.&nbsp; He could think of nothing better than to secure him from
want for the rest of his days.&nbsp; There were many qualities in Loo
Barebone which he did not understand, for they were quite foreign to
the qualities held to be virtues in Farlingford; such as perseverance
and method, a careful economy, and a rigid common sense.&nbsp; Frenchman
had brought these strange ways into Farlingford when he was himself
only a boy of ten, and they had survived his own bringing up in some
of the austerest houses in the town, so vitally as to enable him to
bequeath them almost unchastened to his son.</p>
<p>As has been noted, Loo had easily lived down the prejudices of his
own generation against an un-English gaiety, and inconsequence almost
amounting to emotion.&nbsp; And nothing is, or was in the solid days
before these trumpet-blowing times, so unwelcome in British circles
as emotion.</p>
<p>Frenchman had no doubt prepared the way for his son; but the peculiarities
of thought and manner which might be allowed to pass in a foreigner
would be less easily forgiven in Loo, who had Farlingford blood in his
veins.&nbsp; For his mother had been a Clubbe, own cousin, and, as gossips
whispered, once the sweetheart of Captain Clubbe himself and daughter
of Seth Clubbe of Maiden&rsquo;s Grave, one of the largest farmers on
the Marsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cannot be for no particular purpose that the boy has been
created so different from any about him,&rdquo; Captain Clubbe muttered,
reflectively, as he thought of Dormer Colville&rsquo;s words.&nbsp;
For he had that simple faith in an Almighty Purpose, without which no
wise man will be found to do business on blue water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange how a man may be allowed to inherit from a grandfather
he has never seen a trick of manner, or a face which are not the manner
or face of his father,&rdquo; observed Colville, adapting himself, as
was his habit, to the humour of his companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;There must,
as you suggest, be some purpose in it.&nbsp; God writes straight on
crooked lines, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Dormer Colville found two points of sympathy with this skipper
of a slow coaster, who had never made a mistake at sea nor done an injustice
to any one serving under him: a simple faith in the Almighty Purpose
and a very honest respect for money.&nbsp; This was the beginning of
a sort of alliance between four persons of very different character
which was to influence the whole lives of many.</p>
<p>They sat on the tarred seat set against the weather-beaten wall of
&ldquo;The Black Sailor&rdquo; until darkness came stealing in from
the sea with the quiet that broods over flat lands, and an unpeopled
shore.&nbsp; Colville had many questions to ask and many more which
he withheld till a fitter occasion.&nbsp; But he learnt that Frenchman
had himself stated his name to be Barebone when he landed, a forlorn
and frightened little boy, on this barren shore, and had never departed
from that asseveration when he came to learn the English language and
marry an English wife.&nbsp; Captain Clubbe told also how Frenchman,
for so he continued to be called long after his real name had been written
twice in the parish register, had soon after his marriage destroyed
the papers carefully preserved by the woman whom he never called mother,
though she herself claimed that title.</p>
<p>She had supported herself, it appeared, by her needle, and never
seemed to want money, which led the villagers to conclude that she had
some secret store upon which to draw when in need.&nbsp; She had received
letters from France, which were carefully treasured by her until her
death, and for long afterward by Frenchman, who finally burnt all at
his marriage, saying that he was now an Englishman and wanted to retain
no ties with France.&nbsp; At this time, Clubbe remembered, Louis XVIII.
was firmly established on the throne of France, the Restoration&mdash;known
as the Second&mdash;having been brought about by the Allied Powers with
a high hand after the Hundred Days and the final downfall of Napoleon.</p>
<p>Frenchman may well have known that it might be worth his while to
return to France and seek fortune there; but he never spoke of this
knowledge nor made reference to the recollections of his childhood,
which cast a cold reserve over his soul and steeped it with such a deadly
hatred of France and all things French, that he desired to sever all
memories that might link him with his native country or awake in the
hearts of any children he should beget the desire to return thither.</p>
<p>A year after his marriage his wife died, and thus her son, left to
the care of a lonely and misanthropic father, was brought up a Frenchman
after all, and lisped his first words in that tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lived long enough to teach him to speak French and think
like a Frenchman, and then he died,&rdquo; said Captain Clubbe&mdash;&ldquo;a
young man reckoning by years, but in mind he was an older man than I
am to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his secret died with him?&rdquo; suggested Dormer Colville,
looking at the end of his cigar with a queer smile.&nbsp; But Captain
Clubbe made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One may suppose that he wanted it to die with him, at all
events,&rdquo; added Colville, tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; was the reply, a local colloquialism
in common use, as a clincher to a closed argument or an unwelcome truth.&nbsp;
Captain Clubbe rose as he spoke and intimated his intention of departing,
by jerking his head sideways at Monsieur de Gemosac, who, however, held
out his hand with a Frenchman&rsquo;s conscientious desire to follow
the English custom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be getting home,&rdquo; said Clubbe, simply.&nbsp;
As he spoke he peered across the marsh toward the river, and Colville,
following the direction of his gaze, saw the black silhouette of a large
lug-sail against the eastern sky, which was softly grey with the foreglow
of the rising moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Colville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Loo Barebone going up with the sea-breeze.&nbsp;
He has been down to the rectory.&nbsp; He mostly goes there in the evening.&nbsp;
There is a creek, you know, runs down from Maiden&rsquo;s Grave to the
river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; answered Colville thoughtfully, almost as if the
creek and the large lug-sail against the sky explained something which
he had not hitherto understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he might have come with you this evening,&rdquo;
he added, after a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I suppose everybody in Farlingford
knows why we are here.&nbsp; He does not seem very anxious to seek his
fortune in France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Clubbe, lifting his stony face to the
sky and studying the little clouds that hovered overhead awaiting the
moon.&nbsp; &ldquo;No&mdash;you are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned with a jerk of the head and left them.&nbsp; The Marquis
de Gemosac watched him depart, and made a gesture toward the darkness
of the night, into which he had vanished, indicative of a great despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;they are of a placidity&mdash;these
English.&nbsp; There is nothing to be done with them, my friend, nothing
to be done with such men as that.&nbsp; Now I understand how it is that
they form a great nation.&nbsp; It is merely because they stand and
let you thump them until you are tired, and then they proceed to do
what they intended to do from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because we know that he who jumps about most actively
will be the first to feel fatigue, Marquis,&rdquo; laughed Colville,
pleasantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you must not judge all England from these
eastern people.&nbsp; It is here that you will find the concentrated
essence of British tenacity and stolidity&mdash;the leaven that leavens
the whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is our misfortune to have to deal with these concentrated
English&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis shrugged his shoulders with that light despair which
is incomprehensible to any but men of Latin race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Marquis! there you are wrong,&rdquo; corrected Dormer
Colville, with a sudden gravity, &ldquo;for we have in Captain Clubbe
the very man we want&mdash;one of the hardest to find in this chattering
world&mdash;a man who will not say too much.&nbsp; If we can only make
him say what we want him to say he will not ruin all by saying more.&nbsp;
It is so much easier to say a word too much than a word too little.&nbsp;
And remember he speaks French as well as English, though, being British,
he pretends that he cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur de Gemosac turned to peer at his companion in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak hopefully, my friend,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
is something in your voice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there?&rdquo; laughed Colville, who seemed elated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There may well be.&nbsp; For that man has been saying things,
in that placid monotone which would have taken your breath away had
you been able to understand them.&nbsp; A hundred times I rejoiced that
you understood no English, for your impatience, Marquis, might have
silenced him as some rare-voiced bird is silenced by a sudden movement.&nbsp;
Yes, Marquis, there is a locket containing a portrait of Marie Antoinette.&nbsp;
There are other things also.&nbsp; But there is one drawback.&nbsp;
The man himself is not anxious to come forward.&nbsp; There are reasons,
it appears, here in Farlingford, why he should not seek his fortune
elsewhere.&nbsp; To-morrow morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dormer Colville rose and yawned audibly.&nbsp; It almost appeared
that he regretted having permitted himself a moment&rsquo;s enthusiasm
on a subject which scarcely affected his interests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning I will see to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.&nbsp; THE LITTLE BOY WHO WAS A KING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The Reverend Septimus Marvin had lost his wife five years earlier.&nbsp;
It was commonly said that he had never been the same man since.&nbsp;
Which was untrue.&nbsp; Much that is commonly said will, on investigation,
be found to be far from the truth.&nbsp; Septimus Marvin had, so to
speak, been the same man since infancy.&nbsp; He had always looked vaguely
at the world through spectacles; had always been at a loss among his
contemporaries&mdash;a generation already tainted by that shallow spirit
of haste which is known to-day as modernity&mdash;at a loss for a word;
at a loss for a companion soul.</p>
<p>He was a scholar and a learned historian.&nbsp; His companions were
books, and he communed in spirit with writers who were dead and gone.</p>
<p>Had he ever been a different man his circumstances would assuredly
have been other.&nbsp; His wife, for instance, would in all human probability
have been alive.&nbsp; His avocation might have been more suited to
his capabilities.&nbsp; He was not intended for a country parish, and
that practical human comprehension of the ultimate value of little daily
details, without which a pastor never yet understood his flock, was
not vouchsafed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passen takes no account o&rsquo; churchyard,&rdquo; River
Andrew had said, and neither he nor any other in Farlingford could account
for the special neglect to which was abandoned that particular corner
of the burial ground where the late Mrs. Marvin reposed beneath an early
Victorian headstone of singular hideousness.</p>
<p>Mr. Marvin always went round the other way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems as he has forgotten her wonderful quick,&rdquo; commented
the women of Farlingford.&nbsp; But perhaps they were wrong.&nbsp; If
he had forgotten, he might be expected to go round by the south side
of the church by accident occasionally, especially as it was the shorter
way from the rectory to the porch.&nbsp; He was an absent-minded man,
but he always remembered, as River Andrew himself admitted, to go north
about.&nbsp; And his wife&rsquo;s grave was overgrown by salted grass
as were the rest.</p>
<p>Farlingford had accepted him, when his College, having no use for
such a dreamer elsewhere, gave him the living, not only with resignation,
but with equanimity.&nbsp; This remote parish, cut off from the busier
mainland by wide heaths and marshes, sparsely provided with ill-kept
roads, had never looked for a bustling activity in its rectors.&nbsp;
Their forefathers had been content with a gentleman, given to sport
and the pursuits of a country squire, marked on the seventh day by a
hearty and robust godliness.&nbsp; They would have preferred Parson
Marvin to have handled a boat and carried a gun.&nbsp; But he had his
good qualities.&nbsp; He left them alone.&nbsp; And they are the most
independent people in the world.</p>
<p>When his wife died, his sister, the widow of an Indian officer, bustled
eastward, from a fashionable Welsh watering-place, just to satisfy herself,
as she explained to her West-country friends, that he would not marry
his cook before six months elapsed.&nbsp; After that period she proposed
to wash her hands of him.&nbsp; She was accompanied by her only child,
Miriam, who had just left school.</p>
<p>Six months later Septimus Marvin was called upon to give away his
sister to a youthful brother officer of her late husband, which ceremony
he performed with a sigh of relief audible in the farthest recess of
the organ loft.&nbsp; While the wedding-bells were still ringing, the
bride, who was not dreamy or vague like her brother, gave Septimus to
understand that he had promised to provide Miriam with a home&mdash;that
he really needed a woman to keep things going at the rectory and to
watch over the tender years of little Sep&mdash;and that Miriam&rsquo;s
boxes were packed.</p>
<p>Septimus had no recollection of the promise.&nbsp; And his sister
was quite hurt that he should say such a thing as that on her wedding
day and spoil everything.&nbsp; He had no business to make the suggestion
if he had not intended to carry it out.&nbsp; So the bride and bridegroom
went away in a shower of good wishes and rice to the life of organized
idleness, for which the gentleman&rsquo;s education and talents eminently
befitted him, and Miriam returned to Farlingford with Septimus.</p>
<p>In those days the railway passed no nearer to Farlingford than Ipswich,
and before the arrival of their train at that station Miriam had thoroughly
elucidated the situation.&nbsp; She had discovered that she was not
expected at the rectory, and that Septimus had never offered of his
own free will the home which he now kindly pressed upon her&mdash;two
truths which the learned historian fondly imagined to be for ever locked
up in his own heart, which was a kind one and the heart of a gentleman.</p>
<p>Miriam also learned that Septimus was very poor.&nbsp; She did not
need to be informed that he was helpless.&nbsp; Her instinct had told
her that long ago.&nbsp; She was only nineteen, but she looked at men
and women with those discerning grey eyes, in which there seemed to
lurk a quiet light like the light of stars, and saw right through them.&nbsp;
She was woman enough&mdash;despite the apparent inconsequence of the
schoolroom, which still lent a vagueness to her thoughts and movements&mdash;to
fall an easy victim to the appeal of helplessness.&nbsp; Years, it would
appear, are of no account in certain feminine instincts.&nbsp; Miriam
had probably been woman enough at ten years of age to fly to the rescue
of the helpless.</p>
<p>She did not live permanently at the rectory, but visited her mother
from time to time, either in England, or at one of the foreign resorts
of idle people.&nbsp; But the visits, as years went by, became shorter
and rarer.&nbsp; At twenty-one Miriam came into a small fortune of her
own, left by her father in the hands of executors, one of whom was that
John Turner, the Paris banker, who had given Dormer Colville a letter
of introduction to Septimus Marvin.&nbsp; The money was sorely needed
at the rectory, and Miriam drew freely enough on John Turner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an extravagant girl,&rdquo; said that astute financier
to her, when they met at the house of Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, at Royan,
in France.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder what you spend it on!&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t
trouble my head about it.&nbsp; You need not explain, you understand.&nbsp;
But you can come to me when you want advice or help.&nbsp; You will
find me&mdash;in the background.&nbsp; I am a fat old man, in the background.&nbsp;
Useful enough in my way, perhaps, even to a pretty girl with a sound
judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were many, who, like Loo Barebone, reflected that there were
other worlds open to Miriam Liston.&nbsp; At first she went into those
other worlds, under the flighty wing of her mother, and looked about
her there.&nbsp; Captain and Mrs. Duncan belonged to the Anglo-French
society, which had sprung into existence since the downfall of Napoleon
I., and was in some degree the outcome of the part played by Great Britain
in the comedy of the Bourbon and Orleanist collapse.&nbsp; Captain Duncan
had retired from the army, changing career from one of a chartered to
an unchartered uselessness, and he herded with tarnished aristocracy
and half-pay failures in the smoking-rooms of Continental clubs.</p>
<p>Miriam returned, after a short experience of this world, to Farlingford,
as to the better part.&nbsp; At first she accepted invitations to some
of the country houses open to her by her connection with certain great
families.&nbsp; But after a time she seemed to fall under the spell
of that quiet life which is still understood and lived in a few remote
places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you find to do all day and to think about at night
at that bleak corner of England?&rdquo; inquired her friends, themselves
restless by day and sleepless by night by reason of the heat of their
pursuit of that which is called pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he wants to marry his cook let him do it and be done with
us,&rdquo; wrote her mother from the south of France.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
and join us at Biarritz.&nbsp; The Prince President will be here this
winter.&nbsp; We shall be very gay . . . . P.S.&nbsp; We shall not ask
you to stay with us as we are hard up this quarter; but to share expenses.&nbsp;
Mind come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miriam remained at Farlingford, and there is nothing to be gained
by seeking to define her motive.&nbsp; There are two arguments against
seeking a woman&rsquo;s motive.&nbsp; Firstly, she probably has none.&nbsp;
Secondly, should she have one she will certainly have a counterfeit,
which she will dangle before your eyes, and you will seize it.</p>
<p>Dormer Colville might almost be considered to belong to the world
of which Captain and Mrs. Duncan were such brilliant ornaments.&nbsp;
But he did not so consider himself.&nbsp; For their world was essentially
British, savoured here and there by a French count or so, at whose person
and title the French aristocracy of undoubted genuineness looked askance.&nbsp;
Dormer Colville counted his friends among these latter.&nbsp; In fact,
he moved in those royalist circles who thought that there was little
to choose between the Napoleonic and the Orleanist <i>r&eacute;gime</i>.&nbsp;
He carefully avoided intimacy with Englishmen whose residence in foreign
parts was continuous and in constant need of explanation.&nbsp; Indeed,
if a man&rsquo;s life needs explanation, he must sooner or later find
himself face to face with some one who will not listen to him.</p>
<p>Colville, however, knew all about Captain Duncan, and knew what was
ignored by many, namely, that he was nothing worse than foolish.&nbsp;
He knew all about Miriam, for he was in the confidence of Mrs. St. Pierre
Lawrence.&nbsp; He knew that that lady wondered why Miriam preferred
Farlingford to the high-bred society of her own circle at Royan and
in Paris.</p>
<p>He thought he knew why Loo Barebone showed so little enterprise.&nbsp;
And he was, as Madame de Chantonnay had frequently told him, more than
half a Frenchman in the quickness of his intuitions.&nbsp; He picked
a flower for his buttonhole from the garden of the &ldquo;Black Sailor,&rdquo;
and set forth the morning after his interview with Captain Clubbe toward
the rectory.&nbsp; It was a cool July morning, with the sun half obscured
by a fog-bank driven in from the sea.&nbsp; Through the dazzling white
of that which is known on these coasts as the water-smoke the sky shone
a cloudless blue.&nbsp; The air was light and thin.&nbsp; It is the
lightest and thinnest air in England.&nbsp; Dormer Colville hummed a
song under his breath as he walked on the top of the dyke.&nbsp; He
was a light-hearted man, full of hope and optimism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I disturbing your studies?&rdquo; he asked, with his easy
laugh, as he came rather suddenly on Miriam and little Sep in the turf-shelter
at the corner of the rectory garden.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must say so if
I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had, indeed, their books, and the boy&rsquo;s face wore that
abstracted look which comes from a very earnest desire not to see the
many interesting things on earth and sea, which always force themselves
upon the attention of the young at the wrong time.&nbsp; Colville had
already secured Sep&rsquo;s friendship by the display of a frank ignorance
of natural history only equalled by his desire to be taught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing history,&rdquo; replied Sep, frankly, jumping
up and shaking hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes.&nbsp; William the Conqueror, ten hundred and sixty-six,
and all the rest of it.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; At least I knew once, but
I have forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re doing French history.&nbsp; Miriam likes
that best, but I hate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;French history,&rdquo; said Colville, thoughtfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; That is interesting.&nbsp; Miss Liston likes that
best, does she?&nbsp; Or, perhaps, she thinks that it is best for you
to know it.&nbsp; Do you know all about Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; admitted Sep, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a little chap like you, I knew many people who
had seen Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette.&nbsp; That was long, long
ago,&rdquo; he added, turning to Miriam to make the admission.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But those are not the things that one forgets, are they, Miss
Liston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wish Sep could know somebody who would make him remember,&rdquo;
answered Miriam, half closing the book in her hand; for she was very
quick and had seen Colville&rsquo;s affable glance take it in in passing,
as it took in everything within sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A King, for instance,&rdquo; he said, slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
King of France.&nbsp; Others&mdash;prophets and righteous men&mdash;have
desired to see that, Miss Liston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed, however, that he had seen enough to know the period which
they were studying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;that in this
studious house you talk and think history, and more especially French
history.&nbsp; It must be very quiet and peaceful.&nbsp; Much more restful
than acting in it as my friend de Gemosac has done all his life, as
I myself have done in a small way.&nbsp; For France takes her history
so much more violently than you do in England.&nbsp; France is tossed
about by it, while England stands and is hammered on the anvil of Time,
as it were, and remains just the same shape as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off and turned to Sep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the story of the little boy who was a King?&rdquo;
he asked, abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They put him in prison and he escaped.&nbsp;
He was carried out in a clothes-basket.&nbsp; Funny, is it not?&nbsp;
And he escaped from his enemies and reached another country, where he
became a sailor.&nbsp; He grew to be a man and he married a woman of
that country, and she died, leaving him with a little boy.&nbsp; And
then he died himself and left the little boy, who was taken care of
by his English relations, who never knew that he was a King.&nbsp; But
he was; for his father was a King before him, and his grandfathers&mdash;far,
far back.&nbsp; Back to the beginning of the book that Miss Liston holds
in her hand.&nbsp; The little boy&mdash;he was an orphan, you see&mdash;became
a sailor.&nbsp; He never knew that he was a King&mdash;the Hope of his
country, of all the old men and the wise men in it&mdash;the holder
of the fate of nations.&nbsp; Think of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story pleased Sep, who sat with open lips and eager eyes, listening
to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it is an interesting story?&nbsp; What do you
think is the end of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Sep, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I.&nbsp; No one knows the end of that story yet.&nbsp;
But if you were a King&mdash;if you were that boy&mdash;what would you
do?&nbsp; Would you go and be a King, or would you be afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I should go and be a King.&nbsp; And fight battles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you would have to leave everybody.&nbsp; You would have
to leave your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not mind that,&rdquo; answered Sep, brutally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would leave Miss Liston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have to,&rdquo; was the reply, with conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said Colville, with a grave nod of the head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I suppose you would have to if you were anything of
a man at all.&nbsp; There would be no alternative&mdash;for a real man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; put in Sep, jumping from side to side on his
seat with eagerness, &ldquo;she would make me&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you,
Miriam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville had turned away and was looking northward toward the creek,
known as Maiden&rsquo;s Grave, running through the marshes to the river.&nbsp;
A large lug-sail broke the flat line of the horizon, though the boat
to which it belonged was hidden by the raised dyke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would she?&rdquo; inquired Colville, absent-mindedly, without
taking his eyes from the sail which was creeping slowly toward them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well&mdash;you know Miss Liston&rsquo;s character better than
I do, Sep.&nbsp; And no doubt you are right.&nbsp; And you are not that
little boy, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter; does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause he turned and glanced sideways at Miriam, who was looking
straight in front of her with steady eyes and white cheeks.</p>
<p>They could hear Loo Barebone singing gaily in the boat, which was
hidden below the level of the dyke.&nbsp; And they watched, in a sudden
silence, the sail pass down the river toward the quay.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.&nbsp; A MISTAKE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The tide was ebbing still when Barebone loosed his boat, one night,
from the grimy steps leading from the garden of Maiden&rsquo;s Grave
farm down to the creek.&nbsp; It was at the farm-house that Captain
Clubbe now lived when on shore.&nbsp; He had lived there since the death
of his brother, two years earlier&mdash;that grim Clubbe of Maiden&rsquo;s
Grave, whose methods of life and agriculture are still quoted on market
days from Colchester to Beccles.</p>
<p>The evenings were shorter now, for July was drawing to a close, and
the summer is brief on these coasts.&nbsp; The moon was not up yet,
but would soon rise.&nbsp; Barebone hoisted the great lug-sail, that
smelt of seaweed and tannin.&nbsp; There was a sleepy breeze blowing
in from the cooler sea, to take the place of that hot and shimmering
air which had been rising all day from the corn-fields.&nbsp; He was
quicker in his movements than those who usually handled these stiff
ropes and held the clumsy tiller.&nbsp; Quick&mdash;and quiet for once.&nbsp;
He had been three nights to the rectory, only to find the rector there,
vaguely kind, looking at him with a watery eye, through the spectacles
which were rarely straight upon his nose, with an unasked question on
his hesitating lips.</p>
<p>For Septimus Marvin knew that Colville, in the name of the Marquis
de Gemosac, had asked Loo Barebone to go to France and institute proceedings
there to recover a great heritage, which it seemed must be his.&nbsp;
And Barebone had laughed and put off his reply from day to day for three
days.</p>
<p>Few knew of it in Farlingford, though many must have suspected the
true explanation of the prolonged stay of the two strangers at the &ldquo;Black
Sailor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Captain Clubbe and Septimus Marvin, Dormer Colville
and Monsieur de Gemosac shared this knowledge, and awaited, impatiently
enough, an answer which could assuredly be only in the affirmative.&nbsp;
Clubbe was busy enough throughout the day at the old slip-way, where
&ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; was under repair&mdash;the last ship, it
appeared likely, that the rotten timbers could support or the old, old
shipwrights mend.</p>
<p>Loo Barebone was no less regular in his attendance at the river-side,
and worked all day, on deck or in the rigging, at leisurely sail-making
or neat seizing of a worn rope.&nbsp; He was gay, and therefore incomprehensible
to a slow-thinking, grave-faced race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I want with a heritage?&rdquo; he asked, carelessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am mate of &lsquo;The Last Hope&rsquo;&mdash;and that is all.&nbsp;
Give me time.&nbsp; I have not made up my mind yet, but I think it will
be No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And oddly enough, it was Colville who preached patience to his companions
in suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him time,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There can only
be one answer to such a proposal.&nbsp; But he is young.&nbsp; It is
not when we are young that we see the world as it really is, but live
in a land of dreams.&nbsp; Give him time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac was impatient, however, and was for telling
Barebone more than had been disclosed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no knowing,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what that <i>canaille</i>
is doing in France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no knowing,&rdquo; admitted Colville, with his air
of suppressing a half-developed yawn, &ldquo;but I think we know, all
the same&mdash;you and I, Marquis.&nbsp; And there is no hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After three days Loo Barebone had still given no answer.&nbsp; As
he hoisted the sail and felt for the tiller in the dark, he was, perhaps,
meditating on this momentous reply, or perhaps he had made up his mind
long before, and would hold to the decision even to his own undoing,
as men do who are impulsive and not strong.&nbsp; The water lapped and
gurgled round the bows, for the wind was almost ahead, and it was only
by nursing the heavy boat that he saved the necessity of making a tack
across the narrow creek.&nbsp; In the morning he had, as usual, run
down into the river and to the slip-way, little suspecting that Miriam
and Sep were just above him behind the dyke, where they had sat three
days before listening to Dormer Colville&rsquo;s story of the little
boy who was a King.&nbsp; To-night he ran the boat into the coarse and
wiry grass where Septimus Marvin&rsquo;s own dinghy lay, half hidden
by the reeds, and he stumbled ashore clutching at the dewy grass as
he climbed the side of the dyke.</p>
<p>He went toward the turf-shelter half despondently, and then stopped
short a few yards away from it.&nbsp; For Miriam was there.&nbsp; He
thought she was alone, and paused to make sure before he spoke.&nbsp;
She was sitting at the far corner, sheltered from the north wind.&nbsp;
For Farlingford is like a ship&mdash;always conscious of the lee- and
the weather-side, and all who live there are half sailors in their habits&mdash;subservient
to the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; said Loo, with a little vexed laugh.&nbsp;
He could see her face turned toward him, but her eyes were only dark
shadows beneath her hair.&nbsp; Her face looked white in the darkness.&nbsp;
Her answering laugh had a soothing note in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;at last?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; Her voice was frank
and quietly assured in its friendliness.&nbsp; They were old comrades,
it seemed, and had never been anything else.&nbsp; The best friendship
is that which has never known a quarrel, although poets and others may
sing the tenderness of a reconciliation.&nbsp; The friendship that has
a quarrel and a reconciliation in it is like a man with a weak place
left in his constitution by a past sickness.&nbsp; He may die of something
else in the end, but the probability is that he must reckon at last
with that healed sore.&nbsp; The friendship may perish from some other
cause&mdash;a marriage, or success in life, one of the two great severers&mdash;but
that salved quarrel is more than likely to recur and kill at last.</p>
<p>These two had never fallen out.&nbsp; And it was the woman who, contrary
to custom, fended the quarrel now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! because I have been here three nights in succession, I
suppose, and did not find you here.&nbsp; I was disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you found Uncle Septimus in his study.&nbsp; I could hear
you talking there until quite late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I was very glad to see him and talk with him.&nbsp;
For it is to him that I owe a certain half-developed impatience with
the uneducated&mdash;with whom I deal all my life, except for a few
hours now and then in the study and here in the turf-shelter with you.&nbsp;
I can see&mdash;even in the dark&mdash;that you look grave.&nbsp; Do
not do that.&nbsp; It is not worth that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off with his easy laugh, as if to banish any suggestion
of gravity coming from himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not worth looking grave about.&nbsp; And I am sorry
if I was rude a minute ago.&nbsp; I had no right, of course, to assume
that you would be here.&nbsp; I suppose it was impertinent&mdash;was
that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not quarrel,&rdquo; she answered, soothingly&mdash;&ldquo;if
that is what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was oddly placid.&nbsp; It almost seemed to suggest that
she had come to-night for a certain purpose; that one subject of conversation
alone would interest her, and that to all others she must turn a deaf
ear.</p>
<p>He came a little nearer, and, leaning against the turf wall, looked
down at her.&nbsp; He was suddenly grave now.&nbsp; The <i>r&ocirc;les</i>
were again reversed; for it was the woman who was tenacious to one purpose
and the man who seemed inconsequent, flitting from grave to gay, from
one thought to another.&nbsp; His apology had been made graciously enough,
but with a queer pride, quite devoid of the sullenness which marks the
pride of the humbly situated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I do not want that,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
want a little sympathy, that is all; because I have been educated above
my station.&nbsp; And I looked for it from those who are responsible
for that which is nearly always a catastrophe.&nbsp; And it is your
uncle who educated me.&nbsp; He is responsible in the first instance,
and, of course, I am grateful to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could never have educated you,&rdquo; put in Miriam, &ldquo;if
you had not been ready for the education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone put aside the point.&nbsp; He must, at all events, have
learnt humility from Septimus Marvin&mdash;a quality not natural to
his temperament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are responsible, as well,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;because
you have taught me a use for the education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; she said, gently and interrogatively, as if
at last he had reached the point to which she wished to bring him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the best use to which I could ever put it.&nbsp; To talk
to you on an equality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked hard at her through the darkness, which was less intense
now; for the moon was not far below the horizon.&nbsp; Her face looked
white, and he thought that she was breathing quickly.&nbsp; But they
had always been friends; he remembered that just in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only natural that I should look forward, when we are
at sea, to coming back here&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused and kicked
the turf-wall with his heel, as if to remind her that she had sat in
the same corner before and he had leant against the same wall, talking
to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are good fellows, of course, with a hundred
fine qualities which I lack, but they do not understand half that one
may say, or think&mdash;even the Captain.&nbsp; He is well educated,
in his way, but it is only the way of a coasting-captain who has risen
by his merits to the command of a foreign-going ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miriam gave an impatient little sigh.&nbsp; He had veered again from
the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that I forget that he is my relative,&rdquo; said
Loo, sharply, detecting in his quickness of thought a passing resentment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not.&nbsp; I never forget that.&nbsp; I am the son of his
cousin.&nbsp; I know that, and thus related to many in Farlingford.&nbsp;
But I have never called him cousin, and he has never asked me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miriam, with averted eyes, in that other voice,
which made him turn and look at her, catching his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, with a sudden laugh of comprehension.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have heard what, I suppose, is common talk in Farlingford.&nbsp;
You know what has brought these people here&mdash;this Monsieur de Gemosac,
and the other&mdash;what is his name?&nbsp; Dormer Colville.&nbsp; You
have heard of my magnificent possibilities.&nbsp; And I&mdash;I had
forgotten all about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw out his arms in a gesture of gay contempt; for even in the
dark he could not refrain from adding to the meaning of mere words a
hundred-fold by the help of his lean hands and mobile face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of it, of course,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;from
several people.&nbsp; But I have heard most from Captain Clubbe.&nbsp;
He takes it more seriously than you do.&nbsp; You do not know, because
he is one of those men who are most silent with those to whom they are
most attached.&nbsp; He thinks that it is providential that my uncle
should have had the desire to educate you, and that you should have
displayed such capacity to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capacity?&rdquo; he protested&mdash;&ldquo;say genius!&nbsp;
Do not let us do things by halves.&nbsp; Genius to learn&mdash;yes;
go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you may laugh,&rdquo; Miriam said, lightly, &ldquo;but
it is serious enough.&nbsp; You will find circumstances too strong for
you.&nbsp; You will have to go to France to claim your&mdash;heritage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, if it means leaving Farlingford for ever and going
to live among strange people, like the Marquis de Gemosac, for instance,
who gives me the impression of a thousand petty ceremonies and a million
futile memories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and lifted his face to the breeze which blew from the sea
over flat stretches of sand and seaweed&mdash;the crispest, most invigorating
air in the world except that which blows on the Baltic shores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer Farlingford.&nbsp; I am half a Clubbe&mdash;and the
other half!&mdash;Heaven knows what that is!&nbsp; The offshoot of some
forgotten seedling blown away from France by a great storm.&nbsp; If
my father knew, he never said anything.&nbsp; And if he knew, and said
nothing, one may be sure that it was because he was ashamed of what
he knew.&nbsp; You never saw him, or you would have known his dread
of France, or anything that was French.&nbsp; He was a man living in
a dream.&nbsp; His body was here in Farlingford, but his mind was elsewhere&mdash;who
knows where?&nbsp; And at times I feel that, too&mdash;that unreality&mdash;as
if I were here, and somewhere else at the same time.&nbsp; But all the
same, I prefer Farlingford, even if it is a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon had risen at last; a waning half-moon, lying low and yellow
in the sky, just above the horizon, casting a feeble light on earth.&nbsp;
Loo turned and looked at Miriam, who had always met his glance with
her thoughtful, steady eyes.&nbsp; But now she turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farlingford is best, at all events,&rdquo; he said, with an
odd conviction.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am only the grandson of old Seth Clubbe,
of Maiden&rsquo;s Grave.&nbsp; I am a Farlingford sailor, and that is
all.&nbsp; I am mate of &lsquo;The Last Hope&rsquo;&mdash;at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a step nearer to her, looking down at her white face, averted
from him.&nbsp; For her voice had been uncertain&mdash;unsteady&mdash;as
if she were speaking against her will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if I am only that,&rdquo; he said, suddenly grave, &ldquo;Farlingford
may still be a dream&mdash;Farlingford and&mdash;you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked, in a quick, mechanical
voice, as if she had reached a desired crisis at last and was prepared
to act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I only mean what I have meant always,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I have been afraid&mdash;afraid.&nbsp; One hears, sometimes,
of a woman who is generous enough to love a man who is a nobody&mdash;to
think only of love.&nbsp; Sometimes&mdash;last voyage, when you used
to sit where you are sitting now&mdash;I have thought that it might
have been my extraordinary good fortune to meet such a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited for some word or sign, but she sat motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;how contemptible
must seem their talk of a heritage in France, when such a thought is
in one&rsquo;s mind, even if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she interrupted, hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were
quite wrong.&nbsp; You were mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistaking in thinking you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she interrupted again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are quite
mistaken, and I am very sorry, of course, that it should have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was singularly collected, and spoke in a matter-of-fact voice.&nbsp;
Barebone&rsquo;s eyes gleamed suddenly; for she had aroused&mdash;perhaps
purposely&mdash;a pride which must have accumulated in his blood through
countless generations.&nbsp; She struck with no uncertain hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, slowly; &ldquo;it is to be regretted.&nbsp;
Is it because I am the son of a nameless father and only the mate of
&lsquo;The Last Hope&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were before the mast&mdash;&rdquo; she answered&mdash;&ldquo;if
you were a King, it would make no difference.&nbsp; It is simply because
I do not care for you in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not care for me&mdash;in that way,&rdquo; he echoed,
with a laugh, which made her move as if she were shrinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
there is nothing more to be said to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her slowly, and then took off his cap as if to bid her
good-bye.&nbsp; But he forgot to replace it, and he went away with the
cap in his hand.&nbsp; She heard the clink of a chain as he loosed his
boat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.&nbsp; IN THE ITALIAN HOUSE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The Abb&eacute; Touvent was not a courageous man, and the perspiration,
induced by the climb from the high-road up that which had once been
the ramp to the Ch&acirc;teau of Gemosac, ran cold when he had turned
the key in the rusty lock of the great gate.&nbsp; It was not a dark
night, for the moon sailed serenely behind fleecy clouds, but the shadows
cast by her silvery light might harbour any terror.</p>
<p>It is easy enough to be philosophic at home in a chair beside the
lamp.&nbsp; Under those circumstances, the Abb&eacute; had reflected
that no one would rob him, because he possessed nothing worth stealing.&nbsp;
But now, out here in the dark, he recalled a hundred instances of wanton
murder duly recorded in the newspaper which he shared with three parishioners
in Gemosac.</p>
<p>He paused to wipe his brow with a blue cotton handkerchief before
pushing open the gate, and, being alone, was not too proud to peep through
the keyhole before laying his shoulder against the solid and weather-beaten
oak.&nbsp; He glanced nervously at the loopholes in the flanking towers
and upward at the machicolated battlement overhanging him, as if any
crumbling peep-hole might harbour gleaming eyes.&nbsp; He hurried through
the passage beneath the vaulted roof without daring to glance to either
side, where doorways and steps to the towers were rendered more fearsome
by heavy curtains of ivy.</p>
<p>The enceinte of the castle of Gemosac is three-sided, with four towers
jutting out at the corners, from which to throw a flanking fire upon
any who should raise a ladder against the great curtains, built of that
smooth, white stone which is quarried at Brant&ocirc;me and on the banks
of the Dordogne.&nbsp; The fourth side of the enceinte stands on a solid
rock, above the little river that loses itself in the flat-lands bordering
the Gironde, so that it can scarce be called a tributary of that wide
water.&nbsp; A moss-grown path round the walls will give a quick walker
ten minutes&rsquo; exercise to make the round from one tower of the
gateway to the other.</p>
<p>Within the enceinte are the remains of the old castle, still solid
and upright; erected, it is recorded, by the English during their long
occupation of this country.&nbsp; A more modern ch&acirc;teau, built
after the final expulsion of the invader, adjoins the ancient structure,
and in the centre of the vast enclosure, raised above the walls, stands
a square house, in the Italian style, built in the time of Marie de
Medici, and never yet completed.&nbsp; There are, also, gardens and
shaded walks and vast stables, a chapel, two crypts, and many crumbling
remains inside the walls, that offered a passive resistance to the foe
in olden time, and as successfully hold their own to-day against the
prying eye of a democratic curiosity.</p>
<p>Above the stables, quite close to the gate, half a dozen rooms were
in the occupation of the Marquis de Gemosac; but it was not to these
that the Abb&eacute; Touvent directed his tremulous steps.</p>
<p>Instead, he went toward the square, isolated house, standing in the
middle of that which had once been the great court, and was now half
garden, half hayfield.&nbsp; The hay had been cut, and the scent of
the new stack, standing against the walls of the oldest ch&acirc;teau
and under its leaking roof, came warm and aromatic to mix with the breath
of the evening primrose and rosemary clustering in disorder on the ill-defined
borders.&nbsp; The grim walls, that had defended the Gemosacs against
franker enemies in other days, served now to hide from the eyes of the
villagers the fact&mdash;which must, however, have been known to them&mdash;that
the Marquis de Gemosac, in gloves, kept this garden himself, and had
made the hay with no other help than that of his old coachman and Marie,
that capable, brown-faced <i>bonne-&agrave;-tout-faire</i>, who is assuredly
the best man in France to-day.</p>
<p>In this clear, southern atmosphere the moon has twice the strength
of that to which we are accustomed in mistier lands, and the Abb&eacute;
looked about him with more confidence as he crossed the great court.&nbsp;
There were frogs in a rainwater tank constructed many years ago, when
some enterprising foe had been known to cut off the water-supply of
a besieged ch&acirc;teau, and their friendly croak brought a sense of
company and comfort to the Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s timid soul.</p>
<p>The door of the Italian house stood open, for the interior had never
been completed, and only one apartment, a lofty banqueting-hall, had
ever been furnished.&nbsp; Within the doorway, the Abb&eacute; fumbled
in the pocket of his soutane and rattled a box of matches.&nbsp; He
carried a parcel in his hand, which he now unfolded, and laid out on
the lid of a mouldy chest half a dozen candles.&nbsp; When he struck
a match a flight of bats whirred out of the doorway, and the Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s
breath whistled through his teeth.</p>
<p>He lighted two candles, and carrying them, alight, in one hand&mdash;not
without dexterity, for candles played an important part in his life&mdash;he
went forward.&nbsp; The flickering light showed his face to be a fat
one, kind enough, gleaming now with perspiration and fear, but shiny
at other times with that Christian tolerance which makes men kind to
their own failings.&nbsp; It was very dark within the house, for all
the shutters were closed.</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; lighted a third candle and fixed it, with a drop
of its own wax, on the high mantel of the great banqueting-hall.&nbsp;
There were four or five candlesticks on side-tables, and a candelabra
stood in the centre of a long table, running the length of the room.&nbsp;
In a few minutes the Abb&eacute; had illuminated the apartment, which
smelt of dust and the days of a dead monarchy.&nbsp; Above his head,
the bats were describing complicated figures against a ceiling which
had once been painted in the Italian style, to represent a trellis roof,
with roses and vines entwined.&nbsp; Half a dozen portraits of men,
in armour and wigs, looked down from the walls.&nbsp; One or two of
them were rotting from their frames, and dangled a despondent corner
out into the room.</p>
<p>There were chairs round the table, set as if for a phantom banquet
amid these mouldering environments, and their high carved backs threw
fantastic shadows on the wall.</p>
<p>While the Abb&eacute; was still employed with the candles, he heard
a heavy step and loud breathing in the hall without, where he had carefully
left a light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not wait for me on the hill, <i>malhonn&ecirc;te</i>?&rdquo;
asked a thick voice, like the voice of a man, but the manner was the
manner of a woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure you must have heard me.&nbsp;
One hears me like a locomotive, now that I have lost my slimness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came into the room as she spoke, unwinding a number of black,
knitted shawls, in which she was enveloped.&nbsp; There were so many
of them, and of such different shape and texture, that some confusion
ensued.&nbsp; The Abb&eacute; ran to her assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Madame,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how can you suspect me
of such a crime?&nbsp; I came early to make these preparations.&nbsp;
And as for hearing you&mdash;would to Heaven I had!&nbsp; For it needs
courage to be a Royalist in these days&mdash;especially in the dark,
by one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to know the shawls, for he disentangled them with skill
and laid them aside, one by one.</p>
<p>The Comtesse de Chantonnay breathed a little more freely, but no
friendly hand could disencumber her of the mountains of flesh, which
must have weighed down any heart less buoyant and courageous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, bah!&rdquo; she cried, gaily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is afraid?&nbsp;
What could they do to an old woman?&nbsp; Ah! you hold up your hands.&nbsp;
That is kind of you.&nbsp; But I am no longer young, and there is my
Albert&mdash;with those stupid whiskers.&nbsp; It is unfilial to wear
whiskers, and I have told him so.&nbsp; And you&mdash;who could harm
you&mdash;a priest?&nbsp; Besides, no one could be a priest, and not
a Royalist, Abb&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Madame, and that is why I am one.&nbsp; Have we
been seen, Madame la Comtesse?&nbsp; The village was quiet, as you came
through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet as my poor husband in his grave.&nbsp; Tell me, Abb&eacute;,
now, honestly, am I thinner?&nbsp; I have deprived myself of coffee
these two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; walked gravely round her.&nbsp; It was quite an excursion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would have you different, Madame, to what you are?&rdquo;
he temporized.&nbsp; &ldquo;To be thin is so ungenerous.&nbsp; And Albert&mdash;where
is he?&nbsp; You have not surely come alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&mdash;and I a widow!&rdquo; replied Madame
de Chantonnay, arranging, with a stout hand, the priceless lace on her
dress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Albert is coming.&nbsp; We brought a lantern, although
it is a moon.&nbsp; It is better.&nbsp; Besides, it is always done by
those who conspire.&nbsp; And Albert had his great cloak, and he fell
up a step in the courtyard and dropped the lantern, and lost it in the
long grass.&nbsp; I left him looking for it, in the dark.&nbsp; He was
not afraid, my brave Albert!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has the dauntless heart of his mother,&rdquo; murmured
the Abb&eacute;, gracefully, as he ran round the table setting the chairs
in order.&nbsp; He had already offered the largest and strongest to
the Comtesse, and it was creaking under her now, as she moved to set
her dress in order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; she admitted, complacently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has
not France produced a Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc and a Duchesse de Berri?&nbsp;
It was not from his father, at all events, that he inherited his courage.&nbsp;
For he was a poltroon, that man.&nbsp; Yes, my dear Abb&eacute;, let
us be honest, and look at life as it is.&nbsp; He was a poltroon, and
I thought I loved him&mdash;for two or three days only, however.&nbsp;
And I was a child then.&nbsp; I was beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was?&rdquo; echoed the Abb&eacute;, reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, wicked one!&nbsp; And you a priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even an ecclesiastic, Madame, may have eyes,&rdquo; he said,
darkly, as he snuffed a candle and, subsequently, gave himself a mechanical
thump on the chest, in the region of the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they should wear blinkers, like a horse,&rdquo; said
Madame, severely, as if wearied by an admiration so universal that it
palled.</p>
<p>At this moment, Albert de Chantonnay entered the room.&nbsp; He was
enveloped in a long black cloak, which he threw off his shoulders and
cast over the back of a chair, not without an obvious appreciation of
its possibilities of the picturesque.&nbsp; He looked round the room
with a mild eye, which refused to lend itself to mystery or a martial
ruthlessness.</p>
<p>He was a young man with a very thin neck, and the whiskers, of which
his mother made complaint, were scarcely visible by the light of the
Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s candles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he said, in a thin tenor voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
are in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came forward to the table, with long, nervous strides.&nbsp; He
was not exactly impressive, but his manner gave the assurance of a distinct
earnestness of purpose.&nbsp; The majority of us are unfortunately situated
toward the world, as regards personal appearance.&nbsp; Many could pass
for great if their physical proportions were less mean.&nbsp; There
are thousands of worthy and virtuous young men who never receive their
due in social life because they have red hair or stand four-feet-six
high, or happen to be the victim of an inefficient dentist.&nbsp; The
world, it would seem, does not want virtue or solid worth.&nbsp; It
prefers appearance to either.&nbsp; Albert de Chantonnay would, for
instance, have carried twice the weight in Royalist councils if his
neck had been thicker.</p>
<p>He nodded to the Abb&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I received your message,&rdquo; he said, in the curt manner
of the man whose life is in his hand, or is understood, in French theatrical
circles, to be thus uncomfortably situated.&nbsp; &ldquo;The letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is here, Monsieur Albert,&rdquo; replied the Abb&eacute;,
who was commonplace, and could not see himself as he wished others to
see him.&nbsp; There was only one Abb&eacute; Touvent, for morning or
afternoon, for church or f&ecirc;te, for the ch&acirc;teau or the cottage.&nbsp;
There were a dozen Albert de Chantonnays, fierce or tender, gay or sad,
a poet or a soldier&mdash;a light persifleur, who had passed through
the mill, and had emerged hard and shining, or a young man of soul,
capable of high ideals.&nbsp; To-night, he was the politician&mdash;the
conspirator&mdash;quick of eye, curt of speech.</p>
<p>He held out his hand for the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to read it, as Monsieur le Marquis instructs me, Monsieur
Albert,&rdquo; hazarded the Abb&eacute;, touching the breast pocket
of his soutane, where Monsieur de Gemosac&rsquo;s letter lay hidden,
&ldquo;to those assembled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, surely, I am to read it to myself first,&rdquo; was the
retort; &ldquo;or else how can I give it proper value?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.&nbsp; A BEGINNING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There may be some who refuse to take seriously a person like Albert
de Chantonnay because, forsooth, he happened to possess a sense of the
picturesque.&nbsp; There are, as a matter of fact, thousands of sensible
persons in the British Isles who fail completely to understand the average
Frenchman.&nbsp; To the English comprehension it is, for instance, surprising
that in time of stress&mdash;when Paris was besieged by a German army&mdash;a
hundred <i>franc-tireur</i> corps should spring into existence, who
gravely decked themselves in sombreros and red waist-cloths, and called
themselves the &ldquo;Companions of Death,&rdquo; or some claptrap title
of a similar sound.&nbsp; Nevertheless, these &ldquo;Companions of Death&rdquo;
fought at Orleans as few have fought since man walked this earth, and
died as bravely as any in a government uniform.&nbsp; Even the stolid
German foe forgot, at last, to laugh at the sombrero worn in midwinter.</p>
<p>It is useless to dub a Frenchman unreal and theatrical when he gaily
carries his unreality and his perception of the dramatic to the lucarne
of the guillotine and meets imperturbably the most real thing on earth,
Death.</p>
<p>Albert de Chantonnay was a good Royalist&mdash;a better Royalist,
as many were in France at this time, than the King&mdash;and, perhaps,
he carried his loyalty to the point that is reached by the best form
of flattery.</p>
<p>Let it be remembered that when, on the 3rd of May, 1814, Louis XVIII.
was reinstated, not by his own influence or exertions, but by the allied
sovereigns who had overthrown Napoleon, he began at once to issue declarations
and decrees as of the nineteenth year of his reign, ignoring the Revolution
and Napoleon.&nbsp; Did this Bourbon really take himself seriously?&nbsp;
Did he really expect the world to overlook Napoleon, or did he know
as all the world knows to-day, that long after the Bourbons have sunk
into oblivion the name of Napoleon will continue to be a household word?</p>
<p>If a situation is thus envisaged by a King, what may the wise expect
from a Royalist?</p>
<p>In the absence of the Marquis de Gemosac, Albert de Chantonnay was
considered to be the leader of the party in that quiet corner of south-western
France which lies north of Bordeaux and south of that great dividing
river, the Loire.&nbsp; He was, moreover, looked upon as representing
that younger blood of France, to which must be confided the hopes and
endeavours of the men, now passing away one by one, who had fought and
suffered for their kings.</p>
<p>It was confidently whispered throughout this pastoral country that
August Persons, living in exile in England and elsewhere, were in familiar
and confidential correspondence with the Marquis de Gemosac, and, in
a minor degree, with Albert de Chantonnay.&nbsp; For kings, and especially
deposed kings, may not be choosers, but must take the instrument that
comes to hand.&nbsp; A constitutional monarch is, by the way, better
placed in this respect, for it is his people who push the instrument
into his grasp, and in the long run the people nearly always read a
man aright despite the efforts of a cheap press to lead them astray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were not written in the Marquis&rsquo;s own writing
I could not have believed it,&rdquo; said Albert de Chantonnay, speaking
aloud his own thoughts.&nbsp; He turned the letter this way and that,
examining first the back of it and then the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has not been through the post,&rdquo; he said to the Abb&eacute;,
who stood respectfully watching his face, which, indeed, inspired little
confidence, for the chin receded in the wrong way&mdash;not like the
chin of a shark, which indicates, not foolishness, but greed of gain&mdash;and
the eyes were large and pale like those of a sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Heaven forbid!&rdquo; cried the Abb&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such
a letter as that!&nbsp; Where should we all be if it were read by the
government?&nbsp; And all know that letters passing through the post
to the address of such as Monsieur Albert are read in passing&mdash;by
the Prince President himself, as likely as not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albert gave a short, derisive laugh, and shrugged his shoulders,
which made his admiring mother throw back her head with a gesture, inviting
the Abb&eacute; to contemplate, with satisfaction, the mother of so
brave a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Voil&agrave;</i>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but tell us,
my son, what is in the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is to be read
to all when they are assembled.&nbsp; In the mean time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish the sentence in words, but by gesture conveyed
that the missive, now folded and placed in his breast-pocket, was only
to be obtained bespattered with his life&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp; And the
Abb&eacute; wiped his clammy brow with some satisfaction that it should
be thus removed from his own timorous custody.</p>
<p>Albert de Chantonnay was looking expectantly at the door, for he
had heard footsteps, and now he bowed gravely to a very old gentleman,
a notary of the town, who entered the room with a deep obeisance to
the Comtesse.&nbsp; Close on the notary&rsquo;s heels came others.&nbsp;
Some were in riding costume, and came from a distance.</p>
<p>One sprightly lady wore evening dress, only partially concealed by
a cloak.&nbsp; She hurried in with a nod for Albert de Chantonnay, and
a kiss for the Comtesse.&nbsp; Her presence had the immediate effect
of imparting an air of practical common-sense energy to the assembly,
which it had hitherto lacked.&nbsp; There was nothing of the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
in this lady, who seemed to over-ride etiquette, and cheerfully ignore
the dramatic side of the proceedings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not wonderful?&rdquo; she whispered aloud, after the
manner of any modern lady at one of those public meetings in which they
take so large a part with so small a result in these later days.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is it not wonderful?&rdquo;&nbsp; And her French, though pure
enough, was full and round&mdash;the French of an English tongue.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have had a long letter from Dormer telling me all about it.&nbsp;
Oh&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And she broke off, silenced by the dark frown
of Albert de Chantonnay, to which her attention had been forcibly directed
by his mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been dining with Madame de Rathe,&rdquo;
she went on, irrepressibly, changing the subject in obedience to Albert
de Chantonnay&rsquo;s frown.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Vicomtesse bids me make
her excuses.&nbsp; She feared an indigestion, so will be absent to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; returned the Comtesse de Chantonnay.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is not that.&nbsp; I happen to know that the Vicomtesse de Rathe has
the digestion of a schoolboy.&nbsp; It is because she has no confidence
in Albert.&nbsp; But we shall see&mdash;we shall see.&nbsp; It is not
for the nobility of Louis Philippe to&mdash;to have a poor digestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Comtesse de Chantonnay made a gesture and a meaning grimace
which would have been alarming enough had her hand and face been less
dimpled with good nature.</p>
<p>There were now assembled about a dozen persons, and the Abb&eacute;
was kept in countenance by two others of his cloth.&nbsp; There were
several ladies; one of whom was young and plain and seemed to watch
Albert de Chantonnay with a timid awe.&nbsp; Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence,
seated next to the Comtesse de Chantonnay, was the only lady who made
any attempt at gay apparel, and thus stood rather conspicuous among
her companions clad in sober and somewhat rusty black.&nbsp; All over
the west of France such meetings of the penniless Royalists were being
held at this time, not, it has been averred, without the knowledge of
the Prince President, who has been credited with the courage to treat
the matter with contempt.&nbsp; About no monarch, living or dead, however,
have so many lies been written, by friend or foe, with good or ill intent,
as about him, who subsequently carried out the astounding feat of climbing
to the throne of France as Napoleon III.&nbsp; And it seems certain
that he has been given credit for knowing much of which he must have
been ignorant to an extent hardly credible, even now, in face of subsequent
events.</p>
<p>The Comtesse de Chantonnay was still tossing her head, at intervals,
at the recollection of the Vicomtesse de Rathe&rsquo;s indigestion.&nbsp;
This was only typical of the feelings that divided every camp in France
at this time&mdash;at any time, indeed, since the days of Charlemagne&mdash;for
the French must always quarrel among themselves until they are actually
on the brink of national catastrophe.&nbsp; And even when they are fallen
into that pit they will quarrel at the bottom, and bespatter each other
with the mud that is there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we all here?&rdquo; asked Albert de Chantonnay, standing
in an effective attitude at the end of the table, with his hand on the
back of his chair.&nbsp; He counted the number of his fellow-conspirators,
and then sat down, drawing forward a candelabra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been summoned in haste,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;by
the request of the Marquis de Gemosac to listen to the perusal of a
letter of importance.&nbsp; It may be of the utmost importance&mdash;to
us&mdash;to France&mdash;to all the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew the letter from his pocket and opened it amid a breathless
silence.&nbsp; His listeners noted the care with which he attended to
gesture and demeanour, and accounted it to him for righteousness; for
they were French.&nbsp; An English audience would have thought him insincere,
and they would have been wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter is dated from a place called Farlingford, in England.&nbsp;
I have never heard of it.&nbsp; It is nowhere near to Twickenham or
Claremont, nor is it in Buckinghamshire.&nbsp; The rest of England&mdash;no
one knows.&rdquo;&nbsp; Albert paused and held up one hand for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; he read&mdash;&ldquo;at last, my friends,
after a lifetime of fruitless search, it seems that I have found&mdash;through
the good offices of Dormer Colville&mdash;not the man we have sought,
but his son.&nbsp; We have long suspected that Louis XVII. must be dead.&nbsp;
Madame herself, in her exile at Frohsdorff, has admitted to her intimates
that she no longer hoped.&nbsp; But here in the full vigour of youth&mdash;a
sailor, strong and healthy, living a simple life on shore as at sea&mdash;I
have found a man whose face, whose form, and manner would clearly show
to the most incredulous that he could be no other than the son of Louis
XVII.&nbsp; A hundred tricks of manner and gesture he has inherited
from the father he scarce remembers, from the grandfather who perished
on the guillotine many years before he himself was born.&nbsp; No small
proof of the man&rsquo;s sincerity is the fact that only now, after
long persuasion, has he consented to place himself in our hands.&nbsp;
I thought of hurrying at once to Frohsdorff to present to the aged Duchess
a youth whom she cannot fail to recognize as her nephew.&nbsp; But better
counsels have prevailed.&nbsp; Dormer Colville, to whom we owe so much,
has placed us in his farther debt for a piece of sage advice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wait,&rsquo; he advises, &lsquo;until the young man has learned
what is expected of him, until he has made the personal acquaintance
of his supporters.&nbsp; Reserve until the end the presentation to the
Duchesse d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me, which must only be made when all the
Royalists in France are ready to act with a unanimity which will be
absolute, and an energy which must prove irresistible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more material proofs than a face so strongly resembling
that of Louis XVI. and Monsieur d&rsquo;Artois, in their early manhood,
as to take the breath away; than a vivacity inherited from his grandmother,
together with an independence of spirit and impatience of restraint;
than the slight graceful form, blue eyes, and fair skin of the little
prisoner of the Temple.&nbsp; There are dates which go to prove that
this boy&rsquo;s father was rescued from a sinking fishing-boat, near
Dieppe, a few days after the little Dauphin was known to have escaped
from the Temple, and to have been hurried to the north coast disguised
as a girl.&nbsp; There is evidence, which Monsieur Colville is now patiently
gathering from these slow-speaking people, that the woman who was rescued
with this child was not his mother.&nbsp; And there are a hundred details
known to the villagers here which go to prove what we have always suspected
to be the case, namely, that Louis XVII. was rescued from the Temple
by the daring and ingenuity of a devoted few who so jealously guarded
their secret that they frustrated their own object; for they one and
all must have perished on the guillotine, or at the hands of some other
assassin, without divulging their knowledge, and in the confusion and
horror of those days the little Dauphin was lost to sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a trinket&mdash;a locket&mdash;containing a miniature,
which I am assured is a portrait of Marie Antoinette.&nbsp; This locket
is in the possession of Dormer Colville, who suggests that we should
refrain from using violence to open it until this can be done in France
in the presence of suitable witnesses.&nbsp; A fall or some mishap has
so crushed the locket that it can only be opened by a jeweller provided
with suitable instruments.&nbsp; It has remained closed for nearly a
quarter of a century, but a reliable witness in whose possession it
has been since he, who was undoubtedly Louis XVII., died in his arms,
remembers the portrait, and has no doubt of its authenticity.&nbsp;
I have told you enough to make it clear to you that my search is at
last ended.&nbsp; What we require now is money to enable us to bring
this King of France to his own; to bring him, in the first place, to
my humble ch&acirc;teau of Gemosac, where he can lie hidden until all
arrangements are made.&nbsp; I leave it to you, my dear Albert, to collect
this preliminary sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Chantonnay folded the letter and looked at the faces surrounding
the dimly lighted table.</p>
<p>Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, who must have known the contents of the
letter, and, therefore, came provided, leaned across the table with
a discreet clink of jewellery and laid before Albert de Chantonnay a
note for a thousand francs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am only an Englishwoman,&rdquo; she said, simply, &ldquo;but
I can help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.&nbsp; THE SECRET OF GEMOSAC</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There is no sentiment so artificial as international hatred.&nbsp;
In olden days it owed its existence to churchmen, and now an irresponsible
press foments that dormant antagonism.&nbsp; Wherever French and English
individuals are thrown together by a common endeavour, both are surprised
at the mutual esteem which soon develops into friendship.&nbsp; But
as nations we are no nearer than we were in the great days of Napoleon.</p>
<p>Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence was only one-quarter French and three-quarters
English.&nbsp; Her grandmother had been a St. Pierre; but it was not
from that lady that she inherited a certain open-handedness which took
her French friends by surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not that she has the cause at heart,&rdquo; commented
Madame de Chantonnay, as she walked laboriously on Albert&rsquo;s arm
down the ramp of the Ch&acirc;teau de Gemosac at the termination of
the meeting.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not for that that she throws her note
of a thousand francs upon the table and promises more when things are
in train.&nbsp; It is because she can refuse nothing to Dormer Colville.&nbsp;
<i>Allez</i>, my son!&nbsp; I have a woman&rsquo;s heart!&nbsp; I know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albert contented himself with a sardonic laugh.&nbsp; He was not
in the humour to talk of women&rsquo;s hearts; for Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence&rsquo;s
action had struck a sudden note of British realism into the harmony
of his political fancies.&nbsp; He had talked so much, had listened
to so much talk from others, that the dream of a restored monarchy had
at last been raised to those far realms of the barely possible in which
the Gallic fancy wanders in moments of facile digestion.</p>
<p>It was sufficient for the emergency that the others present at the
meeting could explain that one does not carry money in one&rsquo;s pocket
in a country lane at night.&nbsp; But in their hearts all were conscious
of a slight feeling of resentment toward Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence; of
a vague sense of disappointment, such as a dreamer may experience on
being roughly awakened.</p>
<p>The three priests folded their hands with complacency.&nbsp; Poverty,
their most cherished possession, spoke for itself in their case.&nbsp;
The notary blinked and fumbled at his lips with yellow fingers in hasty
thought.&nbsp; He was a Royalist notary because there existed in the
country of the Deux S&egrave;vres a Royalist <i>client&egrave;le</i>.&nbsp;
In France, even a washerwoman must hold political views and stand or
fall by them.&nbsp; It was astounding how poor every one felt at that
moment, and it rested, as usual, with a woman&rsquo;s intuition to grasp
the only rope within reach.&nbsp; &ldquo;The vintage,&rdquo; this lady
murmured.&nbsp; The vintage promised to be a bad one.&nbsp; Nothing,
assuredly, could be undertaken, and no promise made, until the vintage
was over.</p>
<p>So the meeting broke up without romance, and the conspirators dispersed
to their homes, carrying in their minds that mutual distrust which is
ever awakened in human hearts by the chink of gold, while the dormant
national readiness to detect betrayal by England was suddenly wide awake.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence had supplied the one ingredient
necessary to leaven the talk of these dreamers into action.&nbsp; Even
the notary found himself compelled to contribute when Albert de Chantonnay
asked him outright for a subscription.&nbsp; And the priests, ably led
by the Abb&eacute; Touvent, acted after the manner of the sons of Levi
since olden times.&nbsp; They did not give themselves, but they told
others to give, which is far better.</p>
<p>In due course the money was sent to England.&nbsp; It was the plain
truth that the Marquis de Gemosac had not sufficient in his pocket to
equip Loo Barebone with the clothes necessary to a seemly appearance
in France; or, indeed, to cover the expense of the journey thither.&nbsp;
Dormer Colville never had money to spare.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven shaped
me for a rich man,&rdquo; he would say, lightly, whenever the momentous
subject was broached, &ldquo;but forgot to fill my pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was almost the time of the vintage, and the country roads were
dotted with the shambling figures of those knights of industry who seem
to spring from the hedgerows at harvest-time in any country in the world,
when the Abb&eacute; Touvent sought out Marie in her cottage at the
gates of the ch&acirc;teau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A la cave</i>,&rdquo; answered the lady&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the cellar&mdash;do you not know that it is Monday and I wash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; did not repeat his summons on the kitchen table with
the handle of his stick, but drew forward a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is very hot, and that I am tired,&rdquo; he shouted
toward the cellar door, which stood open, giving egress to a warm smell
of soap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely&mdash;and does Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute; want
me to come up as I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion was darkly threatening, and the Abb&eacute; replied
that Marie must take her time, since it was washing-day.</p>
<p>The cottage was built on sloping ground at the gate of the ch&acirc;teau,
probably of the stones used for some earlier fortification.&nbsp; That
which Marie called the cellar was but half underground, and had an exit
to the garden which grew to the edge of the cliff.&nbsp; It was not
long before she appeared at the head of the stone steps, a square-built
woman with a face that had been sunburnt long ago by work in the vineyards,
and eyes looking straight at the world from beneath a square and wrinkled
forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;,&rdquo; she said, shortly&mdash;a
salutation and a comment in one; for it conveyed the fact that she saw
it was he and perceived that he was in his usual health.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is news from Monsieur, I suppose,&rdquo; she added, slowly, turning
down her sleeves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Marquis writes that he is on his way to Gemosac and
wishes you to prepare the ch&acirc;teau for his return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; waved his hand toward the castle gates with an air
suggestive of retainers and lackeys, of busy stables and a hundred windows
lighted after dark.&nbsp; His round eyes did not meet the direct glance
fixed on his face, but wandered from one object to another in the room,
finally lighting on the great key of the ch&acirc;teau gate, which hung
on a nail behind the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Monsieur le Marquis is coming into residence,&rdquo;
said Marie, gravely.</p>
<p>And by way of reply the Abb&eacute; waved his hand a second time
toward the castle walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the worst of it is,&rdquo; he added, timidly, to this
silent admission, &ldquo;that he brings a guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moistened his fat lips and sat smiling in a foolish way at the
open door; for he was afraid of all women, and most afraid of Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she retorted, shortly.&nbsp; &ldquo;To sleep in
the oubliette, one may suppose.&nbsp; For there is no other bed in the
ch&acirc;teau, as you quite well know, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;.&nbsp;
It is another of your kings no doubt.&nbsp; Oh! you need not hold up
your hands&mdash;when Monsieur Albert reads aloud that letter from Monsieur
le Marquis, in England, without so much as closing the door of the banquet
hall!&nbsp; It is as well that it was no other than I who stood on the
stairs outside and heard all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is wrong to listen behind doors,&rdquo; protested the
Abb&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, bah!&rdquo; replied this unregenerate sheep of his flock.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But do not alarm yourself, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;, I can
keep a quiet tongue.&nbsp; And a political secret&mdash;what is it?&nbsp;
It is an amusement for the rich&mdash;your politics&mdash;but a vice
for the poor.&nbsp; Come, let us go to the ch&acirc;teau, while there
is still day, and you can see for yourself whether we are ready for
a guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she spoke she hastily completed a toilet, which, despite the
Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s caution, had the appearance of incompleteness, and
taking the great key from behind the door, led the way out into the
glare of the setting sun.&nbsp; She unlocked the great gate and threw
her weight against it with quick, firm movements like the movements
of a man.&nbsp; Indeed, she was a better man than her companion; of
a stronger common sense; with lither limbs and a stouter heart; the
best man that France has latterly produced, and, so far as the student
of racial degeneration may foretell, will ever produce again&mdash;her
middle-class woman.</p>
<p>Built close against the flanking tower on the left hand of the courtyard
was a low, square house of two stories only.&nbsp; The whole ground
floor was stabling, room and to spare for half a hundred horses, and
filled frequently enough, no doubt, in the great days of the Great Henry.&nbsp;
On the first floor, to which three or four staircases gave access, there
were plenty of apartments; indeed, suites of them.&nbsp; But nearly
all stood empty, and the row of windows looked blank and curtainless
across the crumbling garden to the Italian house.</p>
<p>It was one of the many tragedies of that smiling, sunny land where
only man, it seems, is vile; for nature has enclosed within its frontier-lines
all the varied wealth and beauty of her treasures.</p>
<p>Marie led the way up the first staircase, which was straight and
narrow.&nbsp; The carpet, carefully rolled and laid aside on the landing,
was threadbare and colourless.&nbsp; The muslin curtains, folded back
and pinned together, were darned and yellow with frequent washing and
the rust of ancient damp.&nbsp; She opened the door of the first room
at the head of the stairs.&nbsp; It had once been the apartment of some
servitor; now it contained furniture of the gorgeous days of Louis XIV.,
with all the colour gone from its tapestry, all the woodwork grey and
worm-eaten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that one,&rdquo; said Marie, as the Abb&eacute; struggled
with the lever that fastened the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;That one has not
been opened for many years.&nbsp; See! the glass rattles in the frame.&nbsp;
It is the other that opens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without comment the Abb&eacute; opened the other window and threw
back the shutters, from which all the paint had peeled away, and let
in the scented air.&nbsp; Mignonette close at hand&mdash;which had bloomed
and died and cast its seed amid the old walls and falling stones since
Marie Antoinette had taught the women of France to take an interest
in their gardens; and from the great plains beyond&mdash;flat and fat&mdash;carefully
laid there by the Garonne to give the world its finest wines, rose up
the subtle scent of vines in bloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drawing-room,&rdquo; said Marie, and making a mock-curtsey
toward the door, which stood open to the dim stairs, she made a grand
gesture with her hand, still red and wrinkled from the wash-tub.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will the King of France be pleased to enter and seat himself?&nbsp;
There are three chairs, but one of them is broken, so his Majesty&rsquo;s
suite must stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a strident laugh she passed on to the next room through folding
doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The principal room,&rdquo; she announced, with that hard irony
in her voice, which had, no doubt, penetrated thither from the soul
of a mother who had played no small part in the Revolution.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
guest-chamber, one may say, provided that Monsieur le Marquis will sleep
on the floor in the drawing-room, or in the straw down below in the
stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; threw open the shutter of this room also and stood
meekly eyeing Marie with a tolerant smile.&nbsp; The room was almost
bare of furniture.&nbsp; A bed such as peasants sleep on; a few chairs;
a dressing-table tottering against the window-breast, and modestly screened
in one corner, the diminutive washing-stand still used in southern France.&nbsp;
For Gemosac had been sacked and the furniture built up into a bonfire
when Marie was a little child and the Abb&eacute; Touvent a fat-faced
timorous boy at the Seminary of Saintes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond is Mademoiselle&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; concluded Marie,
curtly.&nbsp; She looked round her and shrugged her shoulders with a
grim laugh which made the Abb&eacute; shrink.&nbsp; They looked at each
other in silence, the two participants in the secret of Gemosac; for
Marie&rsquo;s husband, the third who had access to the ch&acirc;teau,
did not count.&nbsp; He was a shambling, silent man, now working in
the vineyard beneath the walls.&nbsp; He always did what his wife told
him, without comment or enthusiasm, knowing well that he would be blamed
for doing it badly.</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; had visited the rooms once before, during a brief
passage of the Marquis, soon after his wife&rsquo;s death in Paris.&nbsp;
But, as a rule, only Marie and Jean had access to the apartment.&nbsp;
He looked round with an eye always ready with the tear of sympathy;
for he was a soft-hearted man.&nbsp; Then he looked at Marie again,
shamefacedly.&nbsp; But she, divining his thoughts, shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, bah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;one must take the world as
it is.&nbsp; And Monsieur le Marquis is only a man.&nbsp; One sees that,
when he announces his return on washing-day, and brings a guest.&nbsp;
You must write to him, that is all, and tell him that with time I can
arrange, but not in a hurry like this.&nbsp; Where is the furniture
to come from?&nbsp; A chair or two from the banquet-hall; I can lend
a bed which Jean can carry in after dark so that no one knows; you have
the jug and basin you bought when the Bishop came, that you must lend&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
She broke off and ran to the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; she cried,
in a despairing voice, &ldquo;I hear a carriage coming up the hill.&nbsp;
Run, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;&mdash;run to the gate and bolt it.&nbsp;
Guest or no guest, they cannot see the rooms like this.&nbsp; Here,
let me past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pushed him unceremoniously aside at the head of the stairs and
ran past him.&nbsp; Long concealment of the deadly poverty within the
walls had taught her to close the gates behind her whenever she entered,
but now for greater security, or to gain time, she swung the great oaken
beam round on its pivot across the doors on the inside.&nbsp; Then turning
round on her heels she watched the bell that hung above her head.&nbsp;
The Abb&eacute;, who had followed her as quickly as he could, was na&iuml;vely
looking for a peep-hole between the timbers of the huge doors.</p>
<p>A minute later the bell swung slowly, and gave a single clang which
echoed beneath the vaulted roof, and in the hollow of the empty towers
on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie, Marie!&rdquo; cried a gay girlish voice from without.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Open at once.&nbsp; It is I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Marie, in a whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
Mademoiselle, who has returned from the good Sisters.&nbsp; And the
story that you told of the fever at Saintes is true.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.&nbsp; WITHIN THE GATES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The great bell hanging inside the gates of Gemosac was silent for
two days after the return of Juliette de Gemosac from her fever-stricken
convent school, at Saintes.</p>
<p>But on the third day, soon after nightfall, it rang once more, breaking
suddenly in on the silence of the shadowy courts and gardens, bidding
the frogs in the tank be still with a soft, clear voice, only compassed
by the artificers who worked in days when silver was little accounted
of in the forging of a bell.</p>
<p>It was soon after eight o&rsquo;clock, and darkness had not long
covered the land and sent the workers home.&nbsp; There was no moon.&nbsp;
Indeed, the summons to the gate, coming so soon after nightfall, seemed
to suggest the arrival of a traveller, who had not deemed it expedient
to pass through the winding streets of Gemosac by daylight.</p>
<p>The castle lies on a height, sufficiently removed from the little
town to temper the stir of its streets to a pleasant and unobtrusive
evidence of neighbourhood.&nbsp; Had the traveller come in a carriage,
the sound of its wheels would certainly have been heard; and nearer
at hand, the tramp of horses on the hollow of the old drawbridge, not
raised these hundred years, must have heralded the summons of the bell.&nbsp;
But none of these sounds had warned Juliette de Gemosac, who sat alone
in the little white room upstairs, nor Marie and her husband, dumb and
worn by the day&rsquo;s toil, who awaited bedtime on a stone seat by
the stable door.</p>
<p>Juliette, standing at the open window, heard Jean stir himself, and
shuffle, in his slippers, toward the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is some one who comes on foot,&rdquo; she heard Marie say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Some beggar&mdash;the roads are full of them.&nbsp; See that
he gets no farther than the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard Jean draw back the bolts and answer gruffly, in a few words,
through the interstice of a grudging door, what seemed to be inquiries
made in a voice that was not the voice of a peasant.&nbsp; Marie rose
and went to the gate.&nbsp; In a few minutes they returned, and Juliette
drew back from the window, for they were accompanied by the new-comer,
whose boots made a sharper, clearer sound on the cobble-stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Juliette heard him explain, &ldquo;I am an Englishman,
but I come from Monsieur de Gemosac, for all that.&nbsp; And since Mademoiselle
is here, I must see her.&nbsp; It was by chance that I heard, on the
road, that there is fever at Saintes, and that she had returned home.&nbsp;
I was on my way to Saintes to see her and give her my news of her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what news?&rdquo; asked Marie, and the answer was lost
as the speakers passed into the doorway, the new-comer evidently leading
the way, the peasant and his wife following without protest, and with
that instinctive obedience to unconscious command which will survive
all the iconoclasm of a hundred revolutions.</p>
<p>There followed a tramping on the stairs and a half-suppressed laugh
as the new-comer stumbled upward.&nbsp; Marie opened the door slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a gentleman,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;who does not
give his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juliette de Gemosac was standing at the far side of the table, with
the lamp throwing its full light upon her.&nbsp; She was dressed in
white, with a blue ribbon at her waist and wrists.&nbsp; Another ribbon
of the same colour tied back her hair, which was of a bright brown,
with curls that caught the light in a score of tendrils above her ears.&nbsp;
No finished coquette could have planned a prettier surprise than that
which awaited Loo Barebone, as he made Marie stand aside, and came,
hat in hand, into the room.</p>
<p>He paused for an instant, breathless, before Juliette, who stood,
with a little smile of composed surprise parting her lips.&nbsp; This
child, fresh from the quiet of a convent-school, was in no wise taken
aback nor at a loss how to act.&nbsp; She did not speak, but stood with
head erect, not ungracious, looking at him with clear brown eyes, awaiting
his explanation.&nbsp; And Loo Barebone, all untaught, who had never
spoken to a French lady in his life, came forward with an assurance
and a readiness which must have lain dormant in his blood, awaiting
the magic of this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since my name would convey nothing to Mademoiselle,&rdquo;
he said, with a bow which he had assuredly not learnt in Farlingford,
&ldquo;it was useless to mention it.&nbsp; But it is at the disposal
of Mademoiselle, nevertheless.&nbsp; It is an English name&mdash;Barebone.&nbsp;
I am the Englishman who has been fortunate enough to engage the interest
of your father, who journeyed to England to find me&mdash;and found
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off with a laugh, spreading out his arms to show himself,
as it were, and ask indulgence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a heritage, it appears, in France,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;but know nothing of it, yet.&nbsp; For the weather has been bad
and our voyage a stormy one.&nbsp; I was to have been told during the
journey, but we had no time for that.&nbsp; And I know no more than
you, mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juliette had changed colour, and her cheeks, which were usually of
a most delicate pink, were suddenly quite white.&nbsp; She did not touch
upon the knowledge to which he referred, but went past it to its object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not speak like an Englishman,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For I know one or two.&nbsp; One came to the school at Saintes.&nbsp;
He was a famous English prelate, and he had the manner&mdash;well, of
a tree.&nbsp; And when he spoke, it was what one would expect of a tree,
if it suddenly had speech.&nbsp; But you&mdash;you are not like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loo Barebone laughed with an easy gaiety, which seemed infectious,
though Marie did not join in it, but stood scowling in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have described them exactly.&nbsp;
I know a hundred who are like great trees.&nbsp; Many are so, but they
are kind and still like trees&mdash;the English, when you know them,
mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They?&rdquo; she said, with her prettily arched eyebrows raised
high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, I mean,&rdquo; he answered, quickly, taking her meaning
in a flash.&nbsp; &ldquo;I almost forgot that I was an Englishman.&nbsp;
It is my heritage, perhaps, that makes me forget&mdash;or yourself.&nbsp;
It is so easy and natural to consider one&rsquo;s self a Frenchman&mdash;and
so pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie shuffled with her feet and made a movement of impatience, as
if to remind them that they were still far from the business in hand
and were merely talking of themselves, which is the beginning of all
things&mdash;or may be the beginning of the inevitable end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I forgot,&rdquo; said Barebone, at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
it is getting late.&nbsp; Your father has had a slight misfortune.&nbsp;
He has sprained his ankle.&nbsp; He is on board my ship, the ship of
which I am&mdash;I have been&mdash;an officer, lying at anchor in the
river near here, off the village of Mortagne.&nbsp; I came from Mortagne
at your father&rsquo;s request, with certain messages, for yourself,
mademoiselle, and for Marie&mdash;if Madame is Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the grim voice in the doorway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame
is Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loo had turned toward her.&nbsp; It seemed his happy fate to be able
to disarm antagonism at the first pass.&nbsp; He looked at Marie and
smiled; and slowly, unwillingly, her grim face relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are not to expect Monsieur
le Marquis to-night, nor yet, for some time to come.&nbsp; For he will
go on to Bordeaux, where he can obtain skilled treatment for his injured
ankle, and remain there until he can put his foot to the ground.&nbsp;
He is comfortable enough on board the ship, which will proceed up the
river to-morrow morning to Bordeaux.&nbsp; Monsieur le Marquis also
told me to set your mind at rest on another point.&nbsp; He was to have
brought with him a guest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loo paused and bowed to Marie, with a gay grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A humble one.&nbsp; But I am not to come to Gemosac just now.&nbsp;
I am going, instead, with Monsieur Dormer Colville, to stay at Royan
with Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence.&nbsp; It is, I hope, a pleasure deferred.&nbsp;
I cannot, it appears, show myself in Bordeaux at present, and I quit
the ship to-night.&nbsp; It is some question of myself and my heritage
in France, which I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; said Marie.&nbsp; &ldquo;One can hardly
believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; replied Marie, looking at his face with
a close scrutiny, as if it were familiar to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is all that I had to tell you, Madame Marie,&rdquo;
concluded Barebone.</p>
<p>And, strangely enough, Marie smiled at him as he turned away, not
unkindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he went on, turning again to
Juliette, whose hand was at her hair, for she had been taken by surprise,
&ldquo;my message is simpler.&nbsp; Monsieur, your father, will be glad
to have your society at Bordeaux, while he stays there, if that is true
which the Gironde pilot told him&mdash;of fever at Saintes, and the
hurried dispersal of the schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true enough, monsieur,&rdquo; answered Juliette, in
her low-pitched voice of the south, and with a light of anticipation
in her eye; for it was dull enough at Gemosac, all alone in this empty
ch&acirc;teau.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how am I to reach Bordeaux?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father did not specify the route or method.&nbsp; He
seemed to leave that to you, mademoiselle.&nbsp; He seemed to have an
entire faith in your judgment, and that is why I was so surprised when
I saw you.&nbsp; I thought&mdash;well, I figured to myself that you
were older, you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off with a laugh and a deprecatory gesture of the hand,
as if he had more in his mind but did not want to put it into words.&nbsp;
His meaning was clear enough in his eyes, but Juliette was fresh from
a convent-school, where they seek earnestly to teach a woman not to
be a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One may be young, and still have understanding, monsieur,&rdquo;
she said, with the composed little smile on her demure lips, which must
only have been the composure of complete innocence: almost a monopoly
of children, though some women move through life without losing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Loo, looking into her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
it appears.&nbsp; So, how will you go to Bordeaux?&nbsp; How does one
go from Gemosac to Bordeaux?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By carriage to Mortagne, where a boat is always to be obtained.&nbsp;
It is a short journey, if the tide is favourable,&rdquo; broke in Marie,
who was practical before she was polite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Loo, as quick as thought, &ldquo;drive back
with me now to Mortagne.&nbsp; I have left my horse in the town, my
boat at the pier at Mortagne.&nbsp; It is an hour&rsquo;s drive.&nbsp;
In an hour and a half you will be on board &lsquo;The Last Hope,&rsquo;
at anchor in the river.&nbsp; There is accommodation on board for both
you and Madame; for I, alas! leave the ship to-night with Monsieur Colville,
and thus vacate two cabins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juliette reflected for a moment, but she did not consult, even by
a glance, Marie; who, in truth, appeared to expect no such confidences,
but awaited the decision with a grim and grudging servitude which was
as deeply pressed in upon her soul as was the habit of command in the
soul of a de Gemosac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Juliette, at length, &ldquo;that will be
best.&nbsp; It is, of course, important that my father should reach
Bordeaux as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be there at midday to-morrow, if you will come with
me now,&rdquo; answered Loo, and his gay eyes said &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
as clearly as his lips, though Juliette could not, of course, be expected
to read such signals.</p>
<p>The affair was soon settled, and Jean ordered to put the horse into
the high, old-fashioned carriage still in use at the ch&acirc;teau.&nbsp;
For Juliette de Gemosac seemed to be an illustration of the fact, known
to many much-tried parents, that one is never too young to know one&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a thunder-storm coming from the sea,&rdquo; was Jean&rsquo;s
only comment.</p>
<p>There was some delay in starting; for Marie had to change her own
clothes as well as pack her young mistress&rsquo;s simple trunks.&nbsp;
But the time did not hang heavily on the hands of the two waiting in
the little drawing-room, and Marie turned an uneasy glance toward the
open door more than once at the sound of their laughter.</p>
<p>Barebone was riding a horse hired in the village of Mortagne, and
quitted the ch&acirc;teau first, on foot, saying that the carriage must
necessarily travel quicker than he, as his horse was tired.&nbsp; The
night was dark, and darkest to the west, where lightning danced in and
out among heavy clouds over the sea.</p>
<p>As in all lands that have been torn hither and thither by long wars,
the peasants of Guienne learnt, long ago, the wisdom of dwelling together
in closely built villages, making a long journey to their fields or
vineyards every day.&nbsp; In times past, Gemosac had been a walled
town, dominated, as usual, by the almost impregnable castle.</p>
<p>Barebone rode on, alone, through the deserted vineyards, of which
the scent, like that of a vinery in colder lands, was heavy and damp.&nbsp;
The road runs straight, from point to point, and there was no chance
of missing the way or losing his companions.&nbsp; He was more concerned
with watching the clouds, which were rising in dark towers against the
western sky.&nbsp; He had noted that others were watching them, also,
standing at their doors in every street.&nbsp; It was the period of
thunder and hailstorms&mdash;the deadly foe of the vine.</p>
<p>At length Barebone pulled up and waited; for he could hear the sound
of wheels behind him, and noted that it was not increasing in loudness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you not go faster?&rdquo; he shouted to Jean, when, at
length, the carriage approached.</p>
<p>Jean made no answer, but lashed his horse and pointed upward to the
sky with his whip.&nbsp; Barebone rode in front to encourage the slower
horse.&nbsp; At the village of Mortagne he signed to Jean to wait before
the inn until he had taken his horse to the stable and paid for its
hire.&nbsp; Then he clambered to the box beside him and they rattled
down the long street and out into the open road that led across the
marshes to the port&mdash;a few wooden houses and a jetty, running out
from the shallows to the channel.</p>
<p>When they reached the jetty, going slowly at the last through the
heavy dust, the air was still and breathless.&nbsp; The rounded clouds
still towered above them, making the river black with their deep shadows.&nbsp;
A few lights twinkled across the waters.&nbsp; They were the lightships
marking the middle bank of the Gironde, which is many miles wide at
this spot and rendered dangerous by innumerable sandbanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In five minutes it will be upon us,&rdquo; said Jean.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You had better turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; was the reply, with a reassuring laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the country where I come from they do not turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.&nbsp; THE LIFTED VEIL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the boatman?&rdquo; asked Marie, as she followed
Juliette and Barebone along the deserted jetty.&nbsp; A light burnt
dimly at the end of it and one or two boats must have been moored near
at hand; for the water could be heard lapping under their bows, a secretive,
whispering sound full of mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the boatman,&rdquo; replied Loo, over his shoulder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the good of being afraid?&rdquo; asked this woman
of the world, stopping at the head of the steps and peering down into
the darkness into which he had descended.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the good
of being afraid when one is old and married?&nbsp; I was afraid enough
when I was a girl, and pretty and coquette like Mademoiselle, here.&nbsp;
I was afraid enough then, and it was worth my while&mdash;<i>allez</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone made no answer to this dark suggestion of a sprightly past.&nbsp;
The present darkness and the coming storm commanded his full attention.&nbsp;
In the breathless silence, Juliette and Marie&mdash;and behind them,
Jean, panting beneath the luggage balanced on his shoulder&mdash;could
hear the wet rope slipping through his fingers and, presently, the bump
of the heavy boat against the timber of the steps.</p>
<p>This was followed by the gurgle of a rope through a well-greased
sheave and the square lug, which had been the joy of little Sep Marvin
at Farlingford, crept up to the truck of the stubby mast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no wind for that,&rdquo; remarked Marie, pessimistically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be to spare in a few minutes,&rdquo; answered Barebone,
and the monosyllabic Jean gave an acquiescent grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luggage first,&rdquo; said Barebone, lapsing into the curtness
of the sea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come along.&nbsp; Let us make haste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stumbled on board as best they could, and were guided to a safe
place amidships by Loo, who had thrown a spare sail on the bottom of
the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As low as you can,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Crouch down.&nbsp;
Cover yourselves with this.&nbsp; Right over your heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; grumbled Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; was all the answer he gave her.&nbsp; And as
he spoke, the storm rushed upon them like a train, with the roar and
whirl of a locomotive.</p>
<p>Loo jumped aft to the tiller.&nbsp; In the rush of the hail, they
heard him give a sharp order to Jean, who must have had some knowledge
of the sea, for he obeyed at once, and the boat, set free, lurched forward
with a flap of her sail, which was like the report of a cannon.&nbsp;
For a moment, all seemed confusion and flapping chaos, then came a sense
of tenseness, and the boat heeled over with a swish, which added a hundred-weight
of solid water to the beating of the hail on the spare sail, beneath
which the women crouched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; Did you speak?&rdquo; shouted Loo, putting his
face close to the canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only Marie calling on the saints,&rdquo; was the answer,
in Juliette&rsquo;s laughing voice.</p>
<p>In a few minutes it was over; and, even at the back of the winds,
could be heard the retreat of the hail as it crashed onward toward the
valleys of which every slope is a named vineyard, to beat down in a
few wild moments the result of careful toil and far-sighted expenditure;
to wipe out that which is unique, which no man can replace&mdash;the
vintage of a year.</p>
<p>When the hail ceased beating on it, Juliette pushed back the soaked
canvas, which had covered them like a roof, and lifted her face to the
cooler air.&nbsp; The boat was rushing through the water, and close
to Juliette&rsquo;s cheek, just above the gunwale, rose a curved wave,
green and white, and all shimmering with phosphorescence, which seemed
to hover like a hawk above its prey.</p>
<p>The aftermath of the storm was flying overhead in riven ribbons of
cloud, through which the stars were already peeping.&nbsp; To the westward
the sky was clear, and against the last faint glow of the departed sun
the lightning ran hither and thither, skipping and leaping, without
sound or cessation, like fairies dancing.</p>
<p>Immediately overhead, the sail creaked and tugged at its earings,
while the wind sang its high clear song round mast and halliards.</p>
<p>Juliette turned to look at Barebone.&nbsp; He was standing, ankle
deep, in water, leaning backward to windward, in order to give the boat
every pound of weight he could.&nbsp; The lambent summer-lightning on
the western horizon illuminated his face fitfully.&nbsp; In that moment
Juliette saw what is given to few to see and realise&mdash;though sailors,
perforce, lie down to sleep knowing it every night&mdash;that under
Heaven her life was wholly and solely in the two hands of a fellow-being.&nbsp;
She knew it, and saw that Barebone knew it, though he never glanced
at her.&nbsp; She saw the whites of his eyes gleaming as he looked up,
from moment to moment, to the head of the sail and stooped again to
peer under the foot of it into the darkness ahead.&nbsp; He braced himself,
with one foot against the thwart, to haul in a few inches of sheet,
to which the clumsy boat answered immediately.&nbsp; Marie was praying
aloud now, and when she opened her eyes the sight of the tossing figure
in the stern of the boat suddenly turned her terror into anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that Jean is a fool.&nbsp; And
he, who pretends to have been a fisherman when he was young&mdash;to
let us come to our deaths like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her head, and ducked it again, as a sea jumped up under
the bow and rattled into the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no ship,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us go back,
if we can.&nbsp; Name of God!&mdash;we shall be drowned!&nbsp; I see
no ship, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do,&rdquo; answered Barebone, shaking the water from
his face, for he had no hand to spare.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I do, which
is more important.&nbsp; And you are not even wet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he laughed as he brought the boat up into the wind for a few
seconds, to meet a wild gust.&nbsp; Juliette turned in surprise at the
sound of his voice.&nbsp; In the safe and gentle seclusion of the convent-school
no one had thought to teach her that death may be faced with equanimity
by others than the ordained of the Church, and that in the storm and
stress of life men laugh in strange places and at odd times.</p>
<p>Loo was only thinking of his boat and watching the sky for the last
of the storm&mdash;that smack, as it were, in the face&mdash;with which
the Atlantic ends those black squalls that she sends us, not without
thunder and the curtailed lightning of northern seas.&nbsp; He was planning
and shaping his course; for the watchers on board &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo;
had already seen him, as he could ascertain by a second light, which
suddenly appeared, swung low, casting a gleam across the surf-strewn
water, to show him where the ladder hung overside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Monsieur de Gemosac that I have Mademoiselle and her
maid here in the boat,&rdquo; Barebone called out to Captain Clubbe,
whose large face loomed above the lantern he was holding overside, as
he made fast the rope that had been thrown across his boat and lowered
the dripping sail.&nbsp; The water was smooth enough under the lee of
&ldquo;The Last Hope,&rdquo; which, being deeply laden, lay motionless
at her anchor, with the stream rustling past her cables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand up, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Barebone, himself balanced
on the after-thwart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold on to me, thus, and when I let
you go, let yourself go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time to protest or to ask questions.&nbsp; And Juliette
felt herself passed on from one pair of strong arms to another, until
she was standing on the deck under the humming rigging, surrounded by
men who seemed huge in their gleaming oil-skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said one, who was even larger
than the others, in English, of which she understood enough to catch
his meaning.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will take you to your father.&nbsp; Show
a light this way, one of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His fingers closed round her arm, and he led her, unconscious of
a strength that almost lifted her from her feet, toward an open door,
where a lamp burnt dimly within.&nbsp; It smelt abominably of an untrimmed
wick, Juliette thought, and the next minute she was kissing her father,
who lay full length on a locker in the little cabin.</p>
<p>She asked him a hundred questions, and waited for few of the answers.&nbsp;
Indeed, she supplied most of them herself; for she was very quick and
gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that your foot has been tied
up by a sailor.&nbsp; He has tried to mend it as if it were a broken
spar.&nbsp; I suppose that was the Captain who brought me to you, and
then ran away again, as soon as he could.&nbsp; Yes; I have Marie with
me.&nbsp; She is telling them to be careful with the luggage.&nbsp;
I can hear her.&nbsp; I am so glad we had a case of fever at the school.&nbsp;
It was a lay sister, a stupid woman.&nbsp; But how lucky that I should
be at home just when you wanted me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood upright again, after deftly loosening the bandage round
her father&rsquo;s ankle, and looked at him and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, dear old papa,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;One sees
that you want some one to take care of you.&nbsp; And this cabin-oh!
<i>mon Dieu</i>! how bare and uncomfortable!&nbsp; I suppose men have
to go to sea alone because they can persuade no woman to go with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pounced upon her father again, and arranged afresh the cushions
behind his back, with a little air of patronage and protection.&nbsp;
Her back was turned toward the door, when some one came in, but she
heard the approaching steps and looked quickly round the cabin walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a gay whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
looking-glass! One sees that it is only men who live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she turned, with smiling eyes and a hand upraised to her disordered
hair, to note the new-comer.&nbsp; It was Dormer Colville, who laid
aside his waterproof as he came and greeted her as an old friend.&nbsp;
He had, indeed, known her since her early childhood, and had always
succeeded in keeping pace with her, even in the rapid changes of her
last year at school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is an adventure,&rdquo; he said, shaking hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I can see that you have taken no harm, and have not even
been afraid.&nbsp; For us, it is a pleasant surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at her with a smiling approbation, not without a delicate
suggestion of admiration, such as he might well permit himself, and
she might now even consider her due.&nbsp; He was only keeping pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed behind to initiate your maid, who is, of course,
unused to a ship, and the steward speaks but little French.&nbsp; But
now they are arranging your cabin together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delightful!&rdquo; cried Juliette.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
never been on a ship before, you know.&nbsp; And it is all so strange
and so nice.&nbsp; All those big men, like wet ghosts, who said nothing!&nbsp;
I think they are more interesting than women; perhaps it is because
they talk less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is,&rdquo; admitted Colville, with a sudden gravity,
similar to that with which she had made the suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should hear the Sisters talk&mdash;when they are allowed,&rdquo;
she said, confidentially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whisper when they are not.&nbsp; I can imagine it,&rdquo;
laughed Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;But now you have left all that behind,
and have come out into the world&mdash;of men, one may say.&nbsp; And
you have begun at once with an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; And we are going to Bordeaux, papa and I, until
his foot is well again.&nbsp; Of course, I was in despair when I was
first told of it, but now that I see him I am no longer anxious.&nbsp;
And your messenger assured me that it was not serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused to look round the cabin, to make sure that they were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange he is!&rdquo; she said to both her hearers, in
confidence, looking from one to the other with a quick, birdlike turn
of the head and bright eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never seen any one
like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Dormer Colville, encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he was an Englishman; but, of course, he is not.&nbsp;
He is French, and has not the manner of a <i>bourgeois</i> or a sailor.&nbsp;
He has the manner of an aristocrat&mdash;one would say a Royalist&mdash;like
Albert de Chantonnay, only a thousand times better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Colville, glancing at Monsieur de Gemosac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More interesting, and so quick and amusing.&nbsp; He spoke
of a heritage in France, and yet he said he was an Englishman.&nbsp;
I hope he will secure his heritage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Colville, still looking at Monsieur de
Gemosac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, when we were in the boat,&rdquo; continued Juliette,
still in confidence to them both, &ldquo;he changed quite suddenly.&nbsp;
He was short and sharp.&nbsp; He ordered us to do this and that; and
one did it, somehow, without question.&nbsp; Even Marie obeyed him without
hesitating, although she was half mad with fear.&nbsp; We were in danger.&nbsp;
I knew that.&nbsp; Any one must have known it.&nbsp; And yet I was not
afraid; I wonder why?&nbsp; And he&mdash;he laughed&mdash;that was all.&nbsp;
<i>Mon Dieu</i>! he was brave.&nbsp; I never knew that any one could
be so brave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off suddenly, with her finger to her lips; for some one
had opened the cabin door.&nbsp; Captain Clubbe came in, filling the
whole cabin with his bulk, and on his heels followed Loo Barebone, his
face and hair still wet and dripping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle was wondering,&rdquo; said Dormer Colville, who,
it seemed, was quick to step into that silence which the object of a
conversation is apt to cause&mdash;&ldquo;Mademoiselle was wondering
how it was that you escaped shipwreck in the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! because one has a star.&nbsp; Even a poor sailor may have
a star, mademoiselle.&nbsp; As well as the Prince Napoleon, who boasts
that he has one of the first magnitude, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not a poor sailor, monsieur,&rdquo; said Juliette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who am I?&rdquo; he asked, with a gay laugh, spreading
out his hands and standing before them, beneath the swinging lamp.</p>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac raised himself on one elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you who you are,&rdquo; he said, in a low, quick
voice, pointing one hand at Loo.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And his voice rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the grandson of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette.&nbsp;
You are the Last Hope of the French.&nbsp; That is your heritage.&nbsp;
Juliette! this is the King of France!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juliette turned and looked at him, with all the colour gone from
her face.&nbsp; Then, instinctively, she dropped on one knee, and before
he had understood, or could stop her, had raised his hand to her lips.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.&nbsp; THE TURN OF THE TIDE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tide&rsquo;s a-turning, sir,&rdquo; said a voice at the open
doorway of the cabin, and Captain Clubbe turned his impassive face toward
Dormer Colville, who looked oddly white beneath the light of the lamp.</p>
<p>Barebone had unceremoniously dragged his hand away from the hold
of Juliette&rsquo;s fingers.&nbsp; He made a step back and then turned
toward the door at the sound of his shipmate&rsquo;s well-known voice.&nbsp;
He stood staring out into the darkness like one who is walking in his
sleep.&nbsp; No one spoke, and through the open doorways no sound came
to them but the song of the wind through the rigging.</p>
<p>At last Barebone turned, and there was no sign of fear or misgiving
in his face.&nbsp; He looked at Clubbe, and at no one else, as if the
Captain and he were alone in the cabin where they had passed so many
years together in fair weather, to bring out that which is evil in a
man, and foul, to evolve the good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do <i>you</i> say?&rdquo; he asked, in English, and he
must have known that Captain Clubbe understood French better than he
was ready to admit.</p>
<p>Clubbe passed his hand slowly across his cheek and chin, not in order
to gain time, or because he had not an answer ready, but because he
came of a slow-speaking race.&nbsp; His answer had been made ready weeks
before while he sat on the weather-beaten seat set against the wall
of &ldquo;The Black Sailor&rdquo; at Farlingford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tide&rsquo;s turned,&rdquo; he answered, simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
better get your oilskins on again and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Loo, with a queer laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fancy
I shall want my oilskins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat which had been sent from Royan, at the order of the pilot,
who went ashore there, had followed &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; up the
river, and was now lying under the English ship&rsquo;s stern awaiting
her two passengers and the turn of the tide.</p>
<p>Dormer Colville glanced at the cabin clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, briskly, &ldquo;let us be going.&nbsp;
It will be late enough as it is before we reach my cousin&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and translated his remark for the benefit of the Marquis
and Juliette, remembering that they must needs fail to understand a
colloquy in the muttered and clipped English of the east coast.&nbsp;
He was nervously anxious, it would appear, to tide over a difficult
moment; to give Loo Barebone breathing space, and yet to avoid unnecessary
question and answer.&nbsp; He had not lived forty adventurous years
in the world without learning that it is the word too much which wrecks
the majority of human schemes.</p>
<p>Their preparations had been made beforehand in readiness for the
return of the tide, without the help of which the voyage back to Royan
against a contrary wind must necessarily be long and wearisome.</p>
<p>There was nothing to wait for.&nbsp; Captain Clubbe was not the man
to prolong a farewell or waste his words in wishes for the future, knowing
how vain such must always be.&nbsp; Loo was dazed still by the crash
of the storm and the tension of the effort to bring his boat safely
through it.</p>
<p>The rest had not fully penetrated to his inmost mind yet.&nbsp; There
had been only time to act, and none to think, and when the necessity
to act was past, when he found himself crouching down under the weather
gunwale of the French fishing-boat without even the necessity of laying
hand on sheet or tiller, when, at last, he had time to think, he found
that the ability to do so was no longer his.&nbsp; For Fortune, when
she lifts up or casts down, usually numbs the understanding at the first
turn of her wheel, sending her victim staggering on his way a mere machine,
astonishingly alive to the necessity of the immediate moment, careful
of the next step, but capable of looking neither forward nor backward
with an understanding eye.</p>
<p>The waning moon came up at last, behind a distant line of trees on
the Charente side, lighting up with a silver lining the towering clouds
of the storm, which was still travelling eastward, leaving in its wake
battered vines and ruined crops, searing the face of the land as with
a hot iron.&nbsp; Loo lifted his head and looked round him.&nbsp; The
owner of the boat was at the tiller, while his assistant sat amidships,
his elbows on his knees, looking ahead with dreamy eyes.&nbsp; Close
to Barebone, crouching from the wind which blew cold from the Atlantic,
was Dormer Colville, affably silent.&nbsp; If Loo turned to glance at
him he looked away, but when his back was turned Loo was conscious of
watching eyes, full of sympathy, almost uncomfortably quick to perceive
the inward working of another&rsquo;s mind, and suit his own thereto.</p>
<p>Thus the boat plunged out toward the sea and the flickering lights
that mark the channel, tacking right across to that spit of land lying
between the Gironde and the broad Atlantic, where grows a wine without
match in all the world.&nbsp; Thus Loo Barebone turned his back on the
ship which had been his home so long and set out into a new world; a
new and unknown life, with the Marquis de Gemosac&rsquo;s ringing words
buzzing in his brain yet; with the warm touch of Juliette&rsquo;s lips
burning still upon his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the grandson of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette!&nbsp;
You are the Last Hope of France!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he remembered the lights and shadows on Juliette&rsquo;s hair
as he looked down upon her bent head.</p>
<p>Colville was talking to the &ldquo;patron&rdquo; now.&nbsp; He knew
the coast, it seemed, and, somewhere or other, had learnt enough of
such matters of local seafaring interest as to set the fisherman at
his ease and make him talk.</p>
<p>They were arranging where to land, and Colville was describing the
exact whereabouts of a little jetty used for bathing purposes, which
ran out from the sandy shore, quite near to Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence&rsquo;s
house, in the pine-trees, two miles south of Royan.&nbsp; It was no
easy matter to find this spot by the dim light of a waning moon, and,
half-mechanically, Loo joined in the search, and presently, when the
jetty was reached, helped to make fast in a choppy sea.</p>
<p>They left the luggage on the jetty and walked across the silent sand
side by side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Colville, pointing forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is through that opening in the pine-trees.&nbsp; A matter of five minutes
and we shall be at my cousin&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very kind of Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence,&rdquo; answered
Barebone, &ldquo;to&mdash;well, to take me up.&nbsp; I suppose that
is the best way to look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville laughed quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;put it thus, if you like,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
They walked on in silence for a few yards, and then Dormer Colville
slipped his hand within his companion&rsquo;s arm, as was the fashion
among men even in England in those more expansive days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know how you feel,&rdquo; he said, suiting his step
to Barebone&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must feel like a man who is set
down to a table to play a game of which he knows nothing, and on taking
up his cards finds that he holds a hand all court-cards and trumps&mdash;and
he doesn&rsquo;t know how to play them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone made no answer.&nbsp; He had yet to unlearn Captain Clubbe&rsquo;s
unconscious teaching that a man&rsquo;s feelings are his own concern
and no other has any interest or right to share in them, except one
woman, and even she must guess the larger half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as the game progresses,&rdquo; went on Colville, reassuringly,
&ldquo;you will find out how it is played.&nbsp; You will even find
that you are a skilled player, and then the gambler&rsquo;s spirit will
fire your blood and arouse your energies.&nbsp; You will discover what
a damned good game it is.&nbsp; The great game&mdash;Barebone&mdash;the
great game!&nbsp; And France is the country to play it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stamped his foot on the soil of France as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment I saw you I knew that you would do.&nbsp; No man
better fitted to play the game than yourself; for you have wit and quickness,&rdquo;
went on this friend and mentor, with a little pressure on his companion&rsquo;s
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;But&mdash;you will have to put your back into it,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I noticed at Farlingford a certain reluctance to
begin.&nbsp; It is in the blood, I suppose.&nbsp; There is, you know,
in the Bourbon blood a certain strain of&mdash;well, let us say of reluctance
to begin.&nbsp; Others call it by a different name.&nbsp; One is not
a Bourbon for nothing, I suppose.&nbsp; And everything&mdash;even if
it be a vice&mdash;that serves to emphasise identity is to be cultivated.&nbsp;
But, as I say, you will have to put your back into it later on.&nbsp;
At present there will be less to do.&nbsp; You will have to play close
and hold your hand, and follow any lead that is given you by de Gemosac,
or by my humble self.&nbsp; You will find that easy enough, I know.&nbsp;
For you have all a Frenchman&rsquo;s quickness to understand.&nbsp;
And I suppose&mdash;to put it plainly as between men of the world&mdash;now
that you have had time to think it over&mdash;you are not afraid, Barebone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; laughed Barebone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is not a Barebone&mdash;or a Bourbon&mdash;for nothing,&rdquo;
observed Colville, in an aside to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gad! I wish
I could say that I should not be afraid myself under similar circumstances.&nbsp;
My heart was in my mouth, I can tell you, in that cabin when de Gemosac
blurted it all out.&nbsp; It came suddenly at the end, and&mdash;well!&mdash;it
rather hit one in the wind.&nbsp; And, as I say, one is not a Bourbon
for nothing.&nbsp; You come into a heritage, eight hundred years old,
of likes and dislikes, of genius and incapacity, of an astounding cleverness,
and a preposterous foolishness without compare in the history of dynasties.&nbsp;
But that doesn&rsquo;t matter nowadays.&nbsp; This is a progressive
age, you know; even the Bourbons cannot hold back the advance of the
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come into a heritage of friends and of enemies,&rdquo; said
Barebone, gaily&mdash;&ldquo;all ready made.&nbsp; That seems to me
more important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad! you are right,&rdquo; exclaimed Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
said you would do the moment I saw you step ashore at Farlingford.&nbsp;
You have gone right to the heart of the question at the first bound.&nbsp;
It is your friends and your enemies that will give you trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More especially my friends,&rdquo; suggested Loo, with a light
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right again,&rdquo; answered Colville, glancing at him sideways
beneath the brim of his hat.&nbsp; And there was a little pause before
he spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have probably learnt how to deal with your enemies at
sea,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully at length.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you ever
noticed how an English ship comes into a foreign harbour and takes her
berth at her moorings?&nbsp; There is nothing more characteristic of
the nation.&nbsp; And one captain is like another.&nbsp; No doubt you
have seen Clubbe do it a hundred times.&nbsp; He comes in, all sail
set, and steers straight for the berth he has chosen.&nbsp; And there
are always half a dozen men in half a dozen small boats who go out to
meet him.&nbsp; They stand up and wave their arms, and point this way
and that.&nbsp; They ask a hundred questions, and with their hands round
their faces, shout their advice.&nbsp; And in answer to one and the
other the Captain looks over the side and says, &lsquo;You be damned.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That will be the way to deal with some of your friends and all your
enemies alike, Barebone, if you mean to get on in France.&nbsp; You
will have to look over the side at the people in small boats who are
shouting and say, &lsquo;You be damned.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were at the gate of a house now, set down in a clearing amid
the pine-trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my cousin&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said Dormer Colville.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is to be your home for the present.&nbsp; And you need not
scruple, as she will tell you, to consider it so.&nbsp; It is not a
time to think of obligations, you understand, or to consider that you
are running into any one&rsquo;s debt.&nbsp; You may remember that afterward,
perhaps, but that is as may be.&nbsp; For the present there is no question
of obligations.&nbsp; We are all in the same boat&mdash;all playing
the same game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he laughed below his breath as he closed the gate with caution;
for it was late and the house seemed to hold none but sleepers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for my cousin herself,&rdquo; he continued, as they went
toward the door, &ldquo;you will find her easy to get on with-a clever
woman, and a good-looking one.&nbsp; <i>Du reste</i>&mdash;it is not
in that direction that your difficulties will lie.&nbsp; You will find
it easy enough to get on with the women of the party, I fancy&mdash;from
what I have observed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again he seemed to be amused.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.&nbsp; THE GAMBLERS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In a sense, politics must always represent the game that is most
attractive to the careful gambler.&nbsp; For one may play at it without
having anything to lose.&nbsp; It is one of the few games within the
reach of the adventurous, where no stake need be cast upon the table.&nbsp;
The gambler who takes up a political career plays to win or not to win.&nbsp;
He may jump up from the gutter and shout that he is the man of the moment,
without offering any proof of his assertion beyond the loudness of a
strident voice.&nbsp; And if no one listens to him he loses nothing
but his breath.</p>
<p>And in France the man who shouts loudest is almost certain to have
the largest following.&nbsp; In England the same does not yet hold good,
but the day seems to be approaching when it will.</p>
<p>In France, ever since the great Revolution, men have leapt up from
the gutter to grasp the reins of power.&nbsp; Some, indeed, have sprung
from the gutter of a palace, which is no more wholesome, it would appear,
than the drain of any street, or a ditch that carries off the refuse
of a cheap Press.</p>
<p>There are certain rooms in the north wing of the Louvre, in Paris,
rooms having windows facing across the Rue de Rivoli toward the Palais
Royal, where men must have sat in the comfortable leather-covered chair
of the High Official and laughed at the astounding simplicity of the
French people.&nbsp; But he laughs best who laughs last, and the People
will assuredly be amused in a few months, or a few years, at the very
sudden and very humiliating discomfiture of a gentleman falling face-foremost
into the street or hanging forlornly from a lamp-post at the corner
of it.&nbsp; For some have quitted these comfortable chairs, in these
quiet double-windowed rooms overlooking the Rue de Rivoli, for no better
fate.</p>
<p>It was in the August of 1850 that a stout gentleman, seated in one
of these comfortable chairs, succumbed so far to the warmth of the palace
corridors as to fall asleep.&nbsp; He was not in the room of a high
official, but in the waiting-room attached to it.</p>
<p>He knew, moreover, that the High Official himself was scarcely likely
to dismiss a previous visitor or a present occupation any the earlier
for being importuned; for he was aware of the official&rsquo;s antecedents,
and knew that a Jack-in-office, who has shouted himself into office,
is nearly always careful to be deaf to other voices than his own.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. John Turner was never pressed for time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he had been known to say, &ldquo;I was in Paris
in &rsquo;48.&nbsp; Never missed a meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereas others, with much less at stake than this great banker, had
omitted not only meals, but their night&rsquo;s rest&mdash;night after
night&mdash;in those stirring times.</p>
<p>John Turner was still asleep when the door leading to the Minister&rsquo;s
room was cautiously opened, showing an inner darkness such as prevails
in an alcove between double doors.&nbsp; The door opened a little wider.&nbsp;
No doubt the peeping eye had made sure that the occupant of the waiting-room
was asleep.&nbsp; On the threshold stood a man of middle height, who
carried himself with a certain grace and quiet dignity.&nbsp; He was
pale almost to sallowness, a broad face with a kind mouth and melancholy
eyes, without any light in them.&nbsp; The melancholy must have been
expressed rather by the lines of the brows than by the eye itself, for
this was without life or expression&mdash;the eye of a man who is either
very short-sighted or is engaged in looking through that which he actually
sees, to something he fancies he perceives beyond it.</p>
<p>His lips smiled, but the smile died beneath a neatly waxed moustache
and reached no higher on the mask-like face.&nbsp; Then he disappeared
in the outer darkness between the two doors, and the handle made no
noise in turning.</p>
<p>In a few minutes an attendant, in a gay uniform, came in by the same
door, without seeking to suppress the clatter of his boots on the oak
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hol&agrave;! monsieur,&rdquo; he said, in a loud voice.&nbsp;
And Mr. John Turner crossed his legs and leant farther back in the chair,
preparatory to opening his eyes, which he did directly on the new-comer&rsquo;s
face, without any of that vague flitting hither and thither of glance
which usually denotes the sleeper surprised.</p>
<p>The eyes were of a clear blue, and Mr. Turner looked five years younger
with them open than with them shut.&nbsp; But he was immensely stout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my friend,&rdquo; he said, soothingly; for the Minister&rsquo;s
attendant had a truculent ministerial manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why so much
noise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Minister will see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Turner yawned and reached for his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Minister is pressed for time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I,&rdquo; replied the Englishman, who spoke perfect
French, &ldquo;when I first sat down here, half an hour ago.&nbsp; But
even haste will pass in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose, and followed the servant into the inner room, where he returned
the bow of a little white-bearded gentleman seated at a huge desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said this gentleman, with the abrupt manner
which has come to be considered Napoleonic on the stage or in the political
world to-day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant had withdrawn, closing the door behind him with an emphasis
of the self-accusatory sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a banker,&rdquo; replied John Turner, looking with an
obese deliberation toward one of the deep windows, where, half-concealed
by the heavy curtain, a third person stood gazing down into the street.</p>
<p>The Minister smiled involuntarily, forgetting his dignity of a two-years&rsquo;
growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you may speak before Monsieur,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am behind him,&rdquo; was the immediate reply.</p>
<p>The gentleman leaning against the window-breast did not accept this
somewhat obvious invitation to show his face.&nbsp; He must have heard
it, however, despite an absorption which was probably chronic; for he
made a movement to follow with his glance the passage of some object
of interest in the street below.&nbsp; And the movement seemed to supply
John Turner with the information he desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am a banker,&rdquo; he said, more genially.</p>
<p>The Minister gave a short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;every one in Europe knows
that.&nbsp; Proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I only meddle in politics when I see the possibility of
making an honest penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already made&mdash;that honest penny&mdash;if one may believe
the gossip&mdash;of Europe,&rdquo; said the Minister.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
many pence that it is whispered that you do not know what to do with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unfortunate,&rdquo; admitted Turner, &ldquo;that one
can only dine once a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little gentleman in office had more than once invited his visitor
to be seated, indicating by a gesture the chair placed ready for him.&nbsp;
After a slow inspection of its legs, Mr. John Turner now seated himself.&nbsp;
It would seem that he, at the same time, tacitly accepted the invitation
to ignore the presence of a third person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you seem to know all about me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
will not waste any more of your time, or mine, by trying to make you
believe that I am eminently respectable.&nbsp; The business that brought
me here, however, is of a political nature.&nbsp; A plain man, like
myself, only touches politics when he sees his gain clearly.&nbsp; There
are others who enter that field from purer motives, I am told.&nbsp;
I have not met them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister smiled on one side of his face, and all of it went white.&nbsp;
He glanced uncomfortably at that third person, whom he had suggested
ignoring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; went on John Turner, very dense or greatly
daring, &ldquo;I have lived many years in France, Monsieur le Ministre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister frowned at him, and made a quick gesture of one hand
toward the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; pursued the Englishman, placidly, &ldquo;as
the trains start punctually, and there is not actually grape-shot in
the streets, and one may count upon one&rsquo;s dinner at the hour,
one form of government in this country seems to me to be as good as
another, Monsieur le Ministre.&nbsp; A Bourbon Monarchy or an Orleans
Monarchy, or a Republic, or&mdash;well, an Empire, Monsieur le Ministre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! have you come here to tell me this?&rdquo;
cried the Minister, impatiently, glancing over his shoulder toward the
window, and with one hand already stretched out toward the little bell
standing on his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Turner, leaning forward to draw the bell
out of reach.&nbsp; He nodded his head with a friendly smile, and his
fat cheeks shook.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, and other things as well.&nbsp;
Some of those other matters are perhaps even more worthy of your earnest
attention.&nbsp; It is worth your while to listen.&nbsp; More especially,
as you are paid for it&mdash;by the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed inside himself, with a hollow sound, and placidly crossed
his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I came to tell you, firstly, that the present form of
government, and, er&mdash;any other form which may evolve from it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;proceed, monsieur!&rdquo; exclaimed the Minister,
hastily, while the man in the recess of the window turned and looked
over his shoulder at John Turner&rsquo;s profile with a smile, not unkind,
on his sphinx-like face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;has the inestimable advantage of my passive approval.&nbsp;
That is why I am here, in fact.&nbsp; I should be sorry to see it upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, and turned laboriously in his chair to look toward
the window, as if the gaze of the expressionless eyes there had tickled
the back of his neck like a fly.&nbsp; But by the time the heavy banker
had got round, the curtain had fallen again in its original folds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;by a serious Royalist plot,&rdquo; concluded Turner,
in his thick, deliberate way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, assuredly, would any patriot or any true friend of France,&rdquo;
said the Minister, in his best declamatory manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um&mdash;m.&nbsp; That is out of my depth,&rdquo; returned
the Englishman, bluntly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I paddle about in the shallow
water at the edge and pick up what I can, you understand.&nbsp; I am
too fat for a <i>voyant</i> bathing-costume, and the deep waters beyond,
Monsieur le Ministre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister drummed impatiently on his desk with his five fingers,
and looked at Turner sideways beneath his brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Royalist plots are common enough,&rdquo; he said, tentatively,
after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a Royalist plot with money in it,&rdquo; was the retort.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I dare say an honest politician, like yourself, is aware that
in France it is always safe to ignore the conspirator who has no money,
and always dangerous to treat with contempt him who jingles a purse.&nbsp;
There is only a certain amount of money in the world, Monsieur le Ministre,
and we bankers usually know where it is.&nbsp; I do not mean the money
that the world pours into its own stomach.&nbsp; That is always afloat&mdash;changing
hands daily.&nbsp; I mean the Great Reserves.&nbsp; We watch those,
you understand.&nbsp; And if one of the Great Reserves, or even one
of the smaller reserves, moves, we wonder why it is being moved and
we nearly always find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One supposes,&rdquo; said the Minister, hazarding an opinion
for the first time, and he gave it with a sidelong glance toward the
window, &ldquo;that it is passing from the hands of a financier possessing
money into those of one who has none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; And if a financier possessing money is persuaded
to part with it in such a quarter as you suggest, one may conclude that
he has good reason to anticipate a substantial return for the loan.&nbsp;
You, who are a brilliant collaborateur in the present government, should
know that, if any one does, Monsieur le Ministre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister glanced toward the window, and then gave a good-natured
and encouraging laugh, quite unexpectedly, just as if he had been told
to do so by the silent man looking down into the street, who may, indeed,
have had time to make a gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; pursued the banker, &ldquo;if a financier possessing
money parts with it&mdash;or, to state the case more particularly, if
a financier possessing no money, to my certain knowledge, suddenly raises
it from nowhere definite, for the purposes of a Royalist conspiracy,
the natural conclusion is that the Royalists have got hold of something
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Turner leant back in his chair and suppressed a yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This room is very warm,&rdquo; he said, producing a pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp;
Which was tantamount to a refusal to say more.</p>
<p>The Minister twisted the end of his moustache in reflection.&nbsp;
It was at this time the fashion in France to wear the moustache waxed.&nbsp;
Indeed, men displayed thus their political bias to all whom it might
concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There remains nothing,&rdquo; said the official at length,
with a gracious smile, &ldquo;but to ask your terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For he who was afterward Napoleon the Third had introduced into French
political and social life a plain-spoken cynicism which characterises
both to this day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; replied Turner.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will find them
easy.&nbsp; Firstly, I would ask that your stupid secret police keeps
its fingers out; secondly, that leniency be assured to one person, a
client of mine&mdash;the woman who supplies the money&mdash;who is under
the influence&mdash;well, that influence which makes women do nobler
and more foolish things, monsieur, than men are capable of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose as he spoke, collected his hat and stick, and walked slowly
to the door.&nbsp; With his hand on the handle, he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can think about it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and let me
know at your leisure.&nbsp; By the way, there is one more point, Monsieur
le Ministre.&nbsp; I would ask you to let this matter remain a secret,
known only to our two selves and&mdash;the Prince President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And John Turner went out, without so much as a glance toward the
window.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.&nbsp; ON THE PONT ROYAL</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It would appear that John Turner had business south of the Seine,
though his clients were few in the Faubourg St. Germain.&nbsp; For this
placid British banker was known to be a good hater.&nbsp; His father
before him, it was said, had had dealings with the Bourbons, while many
a great family of the Emigration would have lost more than the esteem
of their fellows in their panic-stricken flight, had it not been that
one cool-headed and calm man of business stayed at his post through
the topsy-turvy days of the Terror, and did his duty by the clients
whom he despised.</p>
<p>On quitting the Louvre, by the door facing the Palais Royal, Turner
moved to the left.&nbsp; To say that he walked would be to overstate
the action of his little stout legs, which took so short a stride that
his progress suggested wheels and some one pushing behind.&nbsp; He
turned to the left again, and ambled under the great arch, to take the
path passing behind the Tuileries.</p>
<p>His stoutness was, in a sense, a safeguard in streets where the travelling
Englishman, easily recognised, has not always found a welcome.&nbsp;
His clothes and his walk were studiously French.&nbsp; Indeed, no one,
passing by with a casual glance, would have turned to look a second
time at a figure so typical of the Paris streets.</p>
<p>Mr. Turner quitted the enclosure of the Tuileries gardens and crossed
the quay toward the Pont Royal.&nbsp; But he stopped short under the
trees by the river wall, with a low whistle of surprise.&nbsp; Crossing
the bridge, toward him, and carrying a carpet-bag of early Victorian
design, was Mr. Septimus Marvin, rector of Farlingford, in Suffolk.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s thought, John Turner went toward the bridge,
and stationed himself on the pavement at the corner.&nbsp; The pavement
is narrow, and Turner was wide.&nbsp; In order to pass him, Septimus
Marvin would need to step into the road.&nbsp; This he did, without
resentment; with, indeed, a courtly and vague inclination of the head
toward the human obstruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Sep,&rdquo; said Turner, &ldquo;you are not going
to pass an old schoolfellow like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Septimus Marvin lurched onward one or two steps, with long loose
strides.&nbsp; Then he clutched his carpet-bag with both hands and looked
back at his interlocutor, with the scared eyes of a detected criminal.&nbsp;
This gave place to the habitual gentle smile when, at last, the recognition
was complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; asked Turner, pointing with
his stick at the carpet-bag.&nbsp; &ldquo;A kitten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; replied Marvin, looking this way and that,
to make sure that none could overhear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Nanteuil&mdash;engraved from his own drawing, Jack&mdash;a
real Nanteuil.&nbsp; I have just been to a man I know&mdash;the print-shop
opposite the statue on the Quai Voltaire&mdash;to have my own opinion
verified.&nbsp; I was sure of it.&nbsp; He says that I am undoubtedly
right.&nbsp; It is a genuine Nanteuil&mdash;a proof before letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; And you have just picked it up cheap?&nbsp; Picked
it up, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, quite the contrary,&rdquo; Marvin replied, in a confidential
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stolen&mdash;dear, dear!&nbsp; I am sorry to hear that, Septimus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Septimus Marvin broke into the jerky, spasmodic laugh of one
who has not laughed for long&mdash;perhaps for years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Jack,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you are still up to a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should hope so.&nbsp; We are quite close to my club.&nbsp;
Come, and have luncheon, and tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Social and Sporting Club, renowned at that day for its matchless
cuisine and for nothing else of good repute at all, entertained an angel
unawares, and was much amused at Septimus Marvin&rsquo;s appearance,
although the amusement was not apparent.&nbsp; The members, it would
appear, were gentlemen of that good school of old France which, like
many good things both French and English, is fast disappearing.&nbsp;
And with all those faults, which we are so ready to perceive in any
Frenchman, there is none on earth who will conceal from you so effectually
the fact that in his heart he is vastly amused.</p>
<p>It was with some difficulty that Septimus was persuaded to consign
his carpet-bag to the custody of the hall-porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t a Nanteuil,&rdquo; he explained in a whisper
to his friend, &ldquo;I should have no hesitation; for I am sure the
man is honest and in every way to be relied upon.&nbsp; But a Nanteuil&mdash;<i>ad
vivum</i>&mdash;Jack.&nbsp; There are none like him.&nbsp; It is priceless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You used not to be a miser,&rdquo; said Turner, panting on
the stairs, when at last the bag was concealed in a safe place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What matter what the value may be, so long as you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but the value is of great importance,&rdquo; answered
Septimus, rather sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have changed a good deal since you and I were at
Ipswich school together.&nbsp; There, sit down at this table.&nbsp;
I suppose you are hungry.&nbsp; I hope you are.&nbsp; Try and think&mdash;there&rsquo;s
a good fellow&mdash;and remember that they have the best cook in Paris
here.&nbsp; Their morals ain&rsquo;t of the first water, but their cook
is without match.&nbsp; Yes, you have changed a good deal, if you think
of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Septimus Marvin had changed colour, at all events, in the last few
minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to, Jack, I have to.&nbsp; That is the truth of it.&nbsp;
I have come to Paris to sell that Nanteuil.&nbsp; To realise, I suppose
you would call it in the financial world.&nbsp; <i>Pro aris et focis</i>,
old friend.&nbsp; I want money for the altar and the hearth.&nbsp; It
has come to that.&nbsp; I cannot ask them in Farlingford for more money,
for I know they have none.&nbsp; And the church is falling about our
ears.&nbsp; The house wants painting.&nbsp; It is going the way of the
church, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Turner, glancing at him over the bill of fare.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So you have to sell an engraving.&nbsp; It goes to the heart,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marvin laughed and rubbed his spare hands together, with an assumption
of cheerfulness in which some one less stout and well-to-do than his
companion might have perceived that dim minor note of pathos, which
always rings somewhere in a forced laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One has to face it,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Ne
cedas malis</i>, you know.&nbsp; I suddenly found it was necessary.&nbsp;
It was forced upon me, in fact.&nbsp; I found that my niece was secretly
helping to make both ends meet.&nbsp; A generous action, made doubly
generous by the manner in which it was performed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miriam?&rdquo; put in John Turner, who appeared to be absorbed
in the all-important document before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miriam.&nbsp; Do you know her?&nbsp; Ah! I forgot.&nbsp;
You are her guardian and trustee.&nbsp; I sometimes think my memory
is failing.&nbsp; I found her out quite by accident.&nbsp; It must have
been going on for quite a long time.&nbsp; Heaven will reward her, Turner!&nbsp;
One cannot doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He absent-mindedly seized two pieces of bread from the basket offered
to him by a waiter, and began to eat as if famished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, man, steady,&rdquo; exclaimed Turner, leaning forward
with a horror-stricken face to restrain him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
spoil a grand appetite on bread.&nbsp; Gad!&nbsp; I wish I could fall
on my food like that.&nbsp; You seem to be starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I forgot to have any breakfast,&rdquo; said Marvin,
apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you did!&rdquo; was the angry retort.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
always were a bit of an ass, you know, Sep.&nbsp; But I have ordered
a tiptop luncheon, and I&rsquo;ll trouble you not to wolf like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said the other, who,
even in the far-off days at Ipswich school, had always been in the clouds,
while John Turner moved essentially on the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do not sell that Nanteuil to the first bidder,&rdquo;
went on Turner, with a glance, of which the keenness was entirely disarmed
by the good-natured roundness of his huge cheeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
a man who will buy it&mdash;at a good price, too.&nbsp; Where did you
get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that is a long story,&rdquo; replied Marvin, looking dreamily
out of the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;I bought it, years ago, at Farlingford.&nbsp;
But it is a long story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell it, slowly.&nbsp; While I eat this <i>sole &agrave;
la Normande</i>.&nbsp; I see you&rsquo;ve nearly finished yours, and
I have scarcely begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a vague and disjointed enough story, as related by Septimus
Marvin.&nbsp; And it was the story of Loo Barebone&rsquo;s father.&nbsp;
As it progressed John Turner grew redder and redder in the face, while
he drank glass after glass of Burgundy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A queer story,&rdquo; he ejaculated, breathlessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
on.&nbsp; And you bought this engraving from the man himself, before
he died?&nbsp; Did he tell you where he got it?&nbsp; It is the portrait
of a woman, you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portrait of a woman&mdash;yes, yes.&nbsp; But he did not know
who she was.&nbsp; And I do not know whether I gave him enough for it.&nbsp;
Do you think I did, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know how much you gave him, but I have no doubt that
it was too much.&nbsp; Where did he get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks it was brought from France by his mother, or the
woman who was supposed in Farlingford to be his mother&mdash;together
with other papers, which he burnt, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes.&nbsp; He died&mdash;but he left a son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil he did!&nbsp; Why did you not mention that before?&nbsp;
Where is the son?&nbsp; Tell me all about him, while I see how they&rsquo;ve
served this <i>langue fourr&eacute;e</i>, which should be eaten slowly;
though it is too late to remind you of that now.&nbsp; Go on.&nbsp;
Tell me all about the son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before the story of Loo Barebone was half told, John Turner laid
aside his knife and fork and turned his attention to the dissection
of this ill-told tale.&nbsp; As the story neared its end, he glanced
round the room, to make sure that none was listening to their conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dormer Colville,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does he
come into it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came to Farlingford with the Marquis de Gemosac, out of
pure good-nature&mdash;because the Marquis could speak but little English.&nbsp;
He is a charming man.&nbsp; So unselfish and disinterested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&nbsp; The Marquis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; Dormer Colville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; said John Turner, returning to the cold tongue.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes; a charming fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he glanced again at his friend, with a queer smile.&nbsp; When
luncheon was finished, Turner led the way to a small smoking-room, where
they would be alone, and sent a messenger to fetch Septimus Marvin&rsquo;s
bag from downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have a look at your precious engraving,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;while we smoke a cigar.&nbsp; It is, I suppose, a relic
of the Great Monarchy, and I may tell you that there is rather a small
demand just now for relics of that period.&nbsp; It would be wiser not
to take it into the open market.&nbsp; I think my client would give
you as good a price as any; and I suppose you want to get as much as
you can for it now that you have made up your mind to the sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marvin suppressed a sigh, and rubbed his hands together with that
forced jocularity which had made his companion turn grave once before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I mean to drive a hard bargain, I can tell you!&rdquo;
was the reply, with an assumption of worldly wisdom on a countenance
little calculated to wear that expression naturally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did your friend in the print-shop on the Quai Voltaire
mention as a probable price?&rdquo; asked Turner, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he said he might be able to sell it for me at four thousand
francs.&nbsp; I would not hear of his running any risk in the matter,
however.&nbsp; Such a good fellow, he is.&nbsp; So honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is likely to be that,&rdquo; said Turner, with his
broad smile.&nbsp; He was a little sleepy after a heavy luncheon, and
sipped his coffee with a feeling of charity toward his fellow-men.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You would find lots of honest men in the Quai Voltaire, Sep.&nbsp;
I will tell you what I will do.&nbsp; Give me the print, and I will
do my best for you.&nbsp; Would ten thousand francs help you out of
your difficulties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not remember saying that I was in difficulties,&rdquo;
objected the Reverend Septimus, with heightened colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Memory <i>is</i> bad, is it not?&nbsp;
Would ten thousand francs paint the rectory, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would ease my mind and sweeten my sleep at night to have
half that sum, my friend.&nbsp; With two hundred pounds I could face
the world <i>&aelig;quo animo</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see what I can do.&nbsp; This is the print, is it?&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know much about such things myself, but I should put the
price down at ten thousand francs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the man in the Quai Voltaire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; I know little about prints, but a lot about
the Quai Voltaire.&nbsp; Who is the lady?&nbsp; I presume it is a portrait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a portrait, but I cannot identify the original.&nbsp;
To an expert of that period it should not be impossible, however.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Septimus Marvin was all awake now, with flushed cheeks and eyes brightened
by enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know why?&nbsp; Because her hair
is dressed in a peculiar way&mdash;<i>poufs de sentiment</i>, these
curls are called.&nbsp; They were only worn for a brief period.&nbsp;
In those days the writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau had a certain vogue
among the idle classes.&nbsp; The women showed their sentiments in the
dressing of their hair.&nbsp; Very curious&mdash;very curious.&nbsp;
And here, in the hair, half-concealed, is an imitation dove&rsquo;s
nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce there is!&rdquo; ejaculated Turner, pulling at his
cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fashion which ruled for a still briefer period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hope so.&nbsp; Well, roll the thing up, and I will
do my best for you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m less likely to be taken in than
you are, perhaps.&nbsp; If I sell it, I will send you a cheque this
evening.&nbsp; It is a beautiful face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Septimus Marvin, with a sharp sigh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a beautiful face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he slowly rolled up his most treasured possession, which John
Turner tucked under his arm.&nbsp; On the Pont Royal they parted company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said John Turner, after they had shaken
hands, &ldquo;you never told me what sort of a man this young fellow
is&mdash;this Loo Barebone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dearest fellow in the world,&rdquo; answered Marvin, with
eyes aglow behind his spectacles.&nbsp; &ldquo;To me he has been as
a son&mdash;an elder brother, as it were, to little Sep.&nbsp; I was
already an elderly man, you know, when Sep was born.&nbsp; Too old,
perhaps.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; Heaven&rsquo;s way is not always marked
very clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded vaguely and went away a few paces.&nbsp; Then he remembered
something and came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I ought to speak of such a thing.&nbsp;
But I quite hoped, at one time, that Miriam might one day recognise
his goodness of heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; interrupted Turner.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mate of
a coasting schooner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is more than that, my friend,&rdquo; answered Septimus
Marvin, nodding his head slowly, so that the sun flashed on his spectacles
in such a manner as to make Turner blink.&nbsp; Then he turned away
again and crossed the bridge, leaving the English banker at the corner
of it, still blinking.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.&nbsp; THE CITY THAT SOON FORGETS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There are in humble life some families which settle their domestic
differences on the doorstep, while the neighbours, gathered hastily
by the commotion, tiptoe behind each other to watch the fun.&nbsp; In
the European congerie France represents this loud-voiced household,
and Paris&mdash;Paris, the city that soon forgets&mdash;is the doorstep
whereon they wrangle.</p>
<p>The bones of contention may be pitched far and wide by the chances
and changes of exile, but the contending dogs bark and yap in Paris.&nbsp;
At this time there lived, sometimes in Italy, sometimes at Frohsdorf,
a jovial young gentleman, fond of sport and society, cultivating the
tastes and enjoying the easy existence of a country-gentleman of princely
rank&mdash;the Comte de Chambord.&nbsp; Son of that Duchesse de Berri
who tried to play a great part and failed, he was married to an Italian
princess and had no children.&nbsp; He was, therefore, the last of the
Bourbons, and passed in Europe as such.&nbsp; But he did not care.&nbsp;
Perhaps his was the philosophy of the indolent which saith that some
one must be last and why not I?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there ran in his veins some energetic blood.&nbsp;
On his father&rsquo;s side he was descended from sixty-six kings of
France.&nbsp; From his mother he inherited a relationship to many makers
of history.&nbsp; For the Duchesse de Berri&rsquo;s grandmother was
the sister of Marie Antoinette.&nbsp; Her mother was aunt to that Empress
of the French, Marie Louise, who was a notable exception to the rule
that &ldquo;Bon sang ne peut mentir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her father was a king
of Sicily and Naples.&nbsp; She was a Bourbon married to a Bourbon.&nbsp;
When she was nineteen she gave birth to a daughter, who died next day.&nbsp;
In a year she had a son who died in twenty hours.&nbsp; Two years later
her husband died in her arms, assassinated, in a back room of the Opera
House in Paris.</p>
<p>Seven months after her husband&rsquo;s death she gave birth to the
Comte de Chambord, the last of the old Bourbons.&nbsp; She was active,
energetic and of boundless courage.&nbsp; She made a famous journey
through La Vend&eacute;e on horseback to rally the Royalists.&nbsp;
She urged her father-in-law, Charles X., to resist the revolution.&nbsp;
She was the best Royalist of them all.&nbsp; And her son was the Comte
de Chambord, who could have been a king if he had not been a philosopher,
or a coward.</p>
<p>He was waiting till France called him with one voice.&nbsp; As if
France had ever called for anything with one voice!</p>
<p>Amid the babel there rang out not a few voices for the younger branch
of the Royal line&mdash;the Orleans.&nbsp; Louis Philippe&mdash;king
for eighteen years&mdash;was still alive, living in exile at Claremont.&nbsp;
Two years earlier, in the rush of the revolution of 1848, he had effected
his escape to Newhaven.&nbsp; The Orleans always seek a refuge in England,
and always turn and abuse that country when they can go elsewhere in
safety.&nbsp; And England is not one penny the worse for their abuse,
and no man or country was ever yet one penny the better for their friendship.</p>
<p>Louis Philippe had been called to the throne by the people of France.&nbsp;
His reign of eighteen years was marked by one great deed.&nbsp; He threw
open the Palace of Versailles&mdash;which was not his&mdash;to the public.&nbsp;
And then the people who called him in, hooted him out.&nbsp; His life
had been attempted many times.&nbsp; All the other kings hated him and
refused to let their daughters marry his sons.&nbsp; He and his sons
were waiting at Claremont while the talkers in Paris talked their loudest.</p>
<p>There was a third bone of contention&mdash;the Imperial line.&nbsp;
At this time the champions of this morsel were at the summit; for a
Bonaparte was riding on the top of the revolutionary scrimmage.</p>
<p>By the death of the great Napoleon&rsquo;s only child, the second
son of his third brother became the recognised claimant to the Imperial
crown.</p>
<p>For France has long ceased to look to the eldest son as the rightful
heir.&nbsp; There is, in fact, a curse on the first-born of France.&nbsp;
Napoleon&rsquo;s son, the King of Rome, died in exile, an Austrian.&nbsp;
The Duc de Bordeaux, born eight years after him, never wore the crown,
and died in exile, childless.&nbsp; The Comte de Paris, born also at
the Tuileries, was exiled when he was ten years old, and died in England.&nbsp;
All these, of one generation.&nbsp; And of the next, the Prince Imperial,
hurried out of France in 1870, perished on the Veldt.&nbsp; The King
of Rome lies in his tomb at Vienna, the Duc de Bordeaux at G&ouml;ritz,
the Comte de Paris at Weybridge, the Prince Imperial at Farnborough.&nbsp;
These are the heirs of France, born in the palace of the Tuileries.&nbsp;
How are they cast upon the waters of the world!&nbsp; And where the
palace of the Tuileries once stood the pigeons now call to each other
beneath the trees, while, near at hand, lolls on the public seat he
whom France has always with her, the <i>vaurien</i>&mdash;the worth-nothing.</p>
<p>So passes the glory of the world.&nbsp; It is not a good thing to
be born in a palace, nor to live in one.</p>
<p>It was in the Rue Lafayette that John Turner had his office, and
when he emerged from it into that long street on the evening of the
25th of August, 1850, he ran against, or he was rather run against by,
the newsboy who shrieked as he pattered along in lamentable boots and
waved a sheet in the face of the passer: &ldquo;The King is dead!&nbsp;
The King is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Paris&mdash;the city that soon forgets&mdash;smiled and asked
what King?</p>
<p>Louis Philippe was dead in England, at the age of seventy-seven,
the bad son of a bad father, another of those adventurers whose happy
hunting-ground always has been, always will be, France.</p>
<p>John Turner, like many who are slow in movement, was quick in thought.&nbsp;
He perceived at once that the death of Louis Philippe left the field
open to the next adventurer; for he left behind him no son of his own
mettle.</p>
<p>Turner went back to his office, where the pen with which he had signed
a cheque for four hundred pounds, payable to the Reverend Septimus Marvin,
was still wet; where, at the bottom of the largest safe, the portrait
of an unknown lady of the period of Louis XVI. lay concealed.&nbsp;
He wrote out a telegram to Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, addressed to her
at her villa near Royan, and then proceeded to his dinner with the grave
face of the careful critic.</p>
<p>The next morning he received the answer, at his breakfast-table,
in the apartment he had long occupied in the Avenue d&rsquo;Antin.&nbsp;
But he did not open the envelope.&nbsp; He had telegraphed to Mrs. St.
Pierre Lawrence, asking if it would be convenient for her to put him
up for a few days.&nbsp; And he suspected that it would not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I am gone,&rdquo; he said to his well-trained servant,
&ldquo;put that into an envelope and send it after me to the Villa Cordouan,
Royan.&nbsp; Pack my portmanteau for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus John Turner set out southward to join a party of those Royalists
whom his father before him had learnt to despise.&nbsp; And in a manner
he was pre-armed; for he knew that he would not be welcome.&nbsp; It
was in those days a long journey, for the railway was laid no farther
than Tours, from whence the traveller must needs post to La Rochelle,
and there take a boat to Royan&mdash;that shallow harbour at the mouth
of the Gironde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have a change&mdash;of cooking,&rdquo; he explained to
Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doctor says I am getting too
stout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook her deliberately by the hand without appearing to notice
her blank looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I came south and shall finish up at Biarritz, which they
say is going to be fashionable.&nbsp; I hope it is not inconvenient
for you to give me a bed&mdash;a solid one&mdash;for a night or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; answered Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, who had charming
manners, and was one of those fortunate persons who are never at a loss.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you not receive my telegram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telling me you were counting the hours till my arrival?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; admitted Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, wisely reflecting
that he would ultimately see the telegram, &ldquo;hardly so fervent
as that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; interrupted Turner, looking behind her toward
the veranda, which was cool and shady, where two men were seated near
a table bearing coffee-cups.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo; asked Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, without turning
to follow the direction of his glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! one is Dormer Colville, I see that.&nbsp; But the other&mdash;gad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say gad?&rdquo; asked the lady, with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he get that face from?&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>Turner took off his hat and mopped his brow; for it was very hot
and the August sun was setting over a copper sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we all get our faces from, I suppose!&rdquo; answered
Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, with her easy laugh.&nbsp; She was always
mistress of the situation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The heavenly warehouse, one
supposes.&nbsp; His name is Barebone.&nbsp; He is a friend of Dormer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any friend of Dormer Colville&rsquo;s commands my interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence glanced quickly at her companion beneath
the shade of her lace-trimmed parasol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; she asked, in a voice suddenly
hard and resentful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he chooses his friends well,&rdquo; returned the banker,
with his guileless smile.&nbsp; His face was bovine, and in the heat
of summer apt to be shiny.&nbsp; No one would attribute an inner meaning
to a stout person thus outwardly brilliant.&nbsp; Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence
appeared to be mollified, and turned toward the house with a gesture
inviting him to walk with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be frank with you,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
telegraphed to tell you that the Villa Cordouan is for the moment unfortunately
filled with guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matter?&nbsp; I will go to the hotel.&nbsp; In fact,
I told the driver of my carriage to wait for further orders.&nbsp; I
half feared that at this time of year, you know, house would be full.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll just shake hands with Colville and then be off.&nbsp; You
will let me come in after dinner, perhaps.&nbsp; You and I must have
a talk about money, you will remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time to answer; for Dormer Colville, perceiving their
approach, was already hurrying down the steps of the veranda to meet
them.&nbsp; He laughed as he came, for John Turner&rsquo;s bulk made
him a laughing matter in the eyes of most men, and his good humour seemed
to invite them to frank amusement.</p>
<p>The greeting was, therefore, jovial enough on both sides, and after
being introduced to Loo Barebone, Mr. Turner took his leave without
farther defining his intentions for the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think it matters much,&rdquo; Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence
said to her two guests, when he had left.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he may not
come, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her self-confidence sufficiently convinced Loo, who was always ready
to leave something to chance.&nbsp; But Colville shook his head.</p>
<p>It thus came about that sundry persons of title and importance who
had been invited to come to the Villa Cordouan after dinner for a little
music found the English banker complacently installed in the largest
chair, with a shirt-front evading the constraint of an abnormal waistcoat,
and a sleepy chin drooping surreptitiously toward it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is my banker from Paris,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. St. Pierre
Lawrence to one and another.&nbsp; &ldquo;He knows nothing, and so far
as I am aware, is no politician&mdash;merely a banker, you understand.&nbsp;
Leave him alone and he will go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the three weeks which Loo Barebone had spent very pleasantly
at the Villa Cordouan, Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence had provided music and
light refreshment for her friends on several occasions.&nbsp; And each
evening the drawing-room, which was not a small one, had been filled
to overflowing.&nbsp; Friends brought their friends and introduced them
to the hostess, who in turn presented them to Barebone.&nbsp; Some came
from a distance, driving from Saintes or La Rochelle or Pons.&nbsp;
Others had taken houses for the bathing-season at Royan itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never makes a mistake,&rdquo; said the hostess to Dormer
Colville, behind her fan, a hundred times, following with her shrewd
eyes the gay and easy movements of Loo, who seemed to be taught by some
instinct to suit his manner to his interlocutor.</p>
<p>To-night there was more music and less conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play him to sleep,&rdquo; Dormer Colville had said to his
cousin.&nbsp; And at length Turner succumbed to the soft effect of a
sonata.&nbsp; He even snored in the shade of a palm, and the gaiety
of the proceedings in no way suffered.</p>
<p>It was only Colville who seemed uneasy and always urged any who were
talking earnestly to keep out of earshot of the sleeping Englishman.&nbsp;
Once or twice he took Barebone by the arm and led him to the other end
of the room, for he was always the centre of the liveliest group and
led the laughter there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but he is charming, my dear,&rdquo; more than one guest
whispered to Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, as they took their departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will do&mdash;he will do,&rdquo; the men said with a new
light of hope in their grave faces.</p>
<p>Nearly all had gone when John Turner at length woke up.&nbsp; Indeed,
Colville threw a book upon the floor to disturb his placid sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come round to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, bidding his hostess
good night.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have some papers for you to sign since you
are determined to sell your <i>rentes</i> and leave the money idle at
your bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I am quite determined,&rdquo; she answered, gaily,
for she was before her time inasmuch as she was what is known in these
days of degenerate speech as cock-sure.</p>
<p>And when John Turner, carrying a bundle of papers, presented himself
at the Villa Cordouan next morning he found Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence
sitting alone in the veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dormer and his friend have left me to my own devices.&nbsp;
They have gone away,&rdquo; she mentioned, casually, in the course of
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she answered, carelessly, and wrote her name
in a clear firm hand on the document before her.&nbsp; And John Turner
looked dense.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.&nbsp; IN THE BREACH</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac was sitting at the open window of the little
drawing-room in the only habitable part of the ch&acirc;teau.&nbsp;
From his position he looked across the courtyard toward the garden where
stiff cypress-trees stood sentry among the mignonette and the roses,
now in the full glory of their autumn bloom.</p>
<p>Beyond the garden, the rough outline of the walls cut a straight
line across the distant plains, which melted away into the haze of the
marsh-lands by the banks of the Gironde far to the westward.</p>
<p>The Marquis had dined.&nbsp; They dined early in those days in France,
and coffee was still served after the evening meal.</p>
<p>The sun was declining toward the sea in a clear copper-coloured sky,
but a fresh breeze was blowing in from the estuary to temper the heat
of the later rays.</p>
<p>The Marquis was beating time with one finger, and within the room,
to an impromptu accompaniment invented by Juliette, Barebone was singing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C&rsquo;est le Hasard,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qui,
t&ocirc;t ou tard,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ici-bas nous seconde;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D&rsquo;un
bout du monde<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A l&rsquo;autre bout,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Le
Hasard seul fait tout.</p>
<p>He broke off with a laugh in which Juliette&rsquo;s low voice joined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is splendid, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he cried, and the Marquis
clapped his thin hands together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Un tel qu&rsquo;on vantait<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par
hasard &eacute;tait<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D&rsquo;origine
assez mince;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par hasard il plut,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Par
hasard il fut<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron, ministre et
prince:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C&rsquo;est le Hasard,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qui,
t&ocirc;t ou tard,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ici bas nous seconde;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D&rsquo;un
bout du monde<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A l&rsquo;autre bout,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Le
Hasard seul fait tout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;that is all I know.&nbsp; It is the only song
I sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are other verses,&rdquo; said Juliette, resting
her hands on the keys of the wheezy spinet which must have been a hundred
years old.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are they about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he answered, looking down
at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it is a love-song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had pinned some mignonette, strong scented as autumn mignonette
is, in the front of her muslin dress, and the heavy heads had dragged
the stems to one side.&nbsp; She put the flowers in order, slowly, and
then bent her head to enjoy the scent of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It scarcely sounds like one,&rdquo; she said, in a low and
inquiring voice.&nbsp; The Marquis was a little deaf.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
it all chance then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he answered, and as he spoke without lowering
his voice she played softly on the old piano the simple melody of his
song.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is all chance, mademoiselle.&nbsp; Did they not
teach you that at the school at Saintes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she was not in a humour to join in his ready laughter.&nbsp;
The room was rosy with the glow of the setting sun, she breathed the
scent of the mignonette at every breath, the air which she had picked
out on the spinet in unison with his clear and sympathetic voice had
those minor tones and slow slurring from note to note which are characteristic
of the gay and tearful songs of southern France and all Spain.&nbsp;
None of which things are conducive to gaiety when one is young.</p>
<p>She glanced at him with one quick turn of the head and made no answer.&nbsp;
But she played the air over again&mdash;the girls sing it to this day
over their household work at Farlingford to other words&mdash;with her
foot on the soft pedal.&nbsp; The Marquis hummed it between his teeth
at the other end of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This room is hot,&rdquo; she exclaimed, suddenly, and rose
from her seat without troubling to finish the melody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that window will not open, mademoiselle; for I have tried
it,&rdquo; added Barebone, watching her impatient movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am going into the garden,&rdquo; she said, with a sharp
sigh and a wilful toss of the head.</p>
<p>It was not his fault that the setting sun, against which, as many
have discovered, men shut their doors, should happen to be burning hot
or that the window would not open.&nbsp; But Juliette seemed to blame
him for it or for something else, perhaps.&nbsp; One never knows.</p>
<p>Barebone did not follow her at once, but stood by the window talking
to the Marquis, who was in a reminiscent humour.&nbsp; The old man interrupted
his own narrative, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is Juliette on that wall overhanging
the river.&nbsp; It is where the English effected a breach long ago,
my friend&mdash;you need not smile, for you are no Englishman&mdash;and
the ch&acirc;teau has only been taken twice through all the centuries
of fighting.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; She ventures still farther.&nbsp; I
have told her a hundred times that the wall is unsafe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go and warn her the hundred-and-first time?&rdquo;
asked Loo, willing enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my friend, do.&nbsp; And speak to her severely.&nbsp;
She is only a child, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I will remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juliette did not seem to hear his approach across the turf where
the goats fed now, but stood with her back toward him, a few feet below
him, actually in that breach effected long ago by those pestilential
English.&nbsp; They must have prized out the great stones with crowbars
and torn them down with their bare hands.</p>
<p>Juliette was looking over the vineyards toward the river, which gleamed
across the horizon.&nbsp; She was humming to herself the last lines
of the song:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D&rsquo;un bout du monde<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
l&rsquo;autre bout,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Le Hasard seul
fait tout.</p>
<p>She turned with a pretty swing of her skirts to gather them in her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go no farther, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Loo.</p>
<p>She stopped, half bending to take her skirt, but did not look back.&nbsp;
Then she took two steps downward from stone to stone.&nbsp; The blocks
were half embedded in the turf and looked ready to fall under the smallest
additional weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not I who say so, but your father who sent me,&rdquo;
explained the admonisher from above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since it is all chance&mdash;&rdquo; she said, looking downward.</p>
<p>She turned suddenly and looked up at him with that impatience which
gives way in later life to a philosophy infinitely to be dreaded when
it comes; for its real name is Indifference.</p>
<p>Her movements were spasmodic and quick as if something angered her,
she knew not what; as if she wanted something, she knew not what.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that it was chance that
saved our lives that night two months ago, out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she stood with one hand stretched out behind her pointing toward
the estuary, which was quiet enough now, looking up at him with that
strange anger or new disquietude&mdash;it was hard to tell which&mdash;glowing
in her eyes.&nbsp; The wind fluttered her hair, which was tied low down
with a ribbon in the mode named &ldquo;&agrave; la diable&rdquo; by
some French wit with a sore heart in an old man&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp;
For none other could have so aptly described it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All chance, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he answered, looking over
her head toward the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it would have been the same had it been only Marie or
Marie and Jean in the boat with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boat would have been as solid and the ropes as strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; asked the girl, with a glance from her persistent
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; he answered, with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should
not have been the same.&nbsp; But you must not continue to stand there,
mademoiselle; the wall is unsafe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders and stood with half-averted face, looking
down at the vineyards which stretched away to the dunes by the river.&nbsp;
Her cheeks were oddly flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father sent me to say so,&rdquo; continued Loo, &ldquo;and
if he sees that you take no heed he will come himself to learn why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juliette gave a curt laugh and climbed the declivity toward him.&nbsp;
The argument was, it seemed, a sound one.&nbsp; When she reached his
level he made a step or two along the path that ran round the enceinte&mdash;not
toward the house, however&mdash;but away from it.&nbsp; She accepted
the tacit suggestion, not tacitly, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we not go and tell papa we have returned without mishap?&rdquo;
she amended, with a light laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; It was his turn
to be grave now and she glanced at him with a gleam of satisfaction
beneath her lids.&nbsp; She was not content with that, however, but
wished to make him angry.&nbsp; So she laughed again and they would
have quarrelled if he had not kept his lips firmly closed and looked
straight in front of him.</p>
<p>They passed between the unfinished ruin known as the Italian house
and the rampart.&nbsp; The Italian house screened them from the windows
of that portion of the ancient stabling which the Marquis had made habitable
when he bought back the ch&acirc;teau of Gemosac from the descendant
of an adventurous republican to whom the estate had been awarded in
the days of the Terror.&nbsp; A walk of lime-trees bordered that part
of the garden which lies to the west of the Italian house, and no other
part was visible from where Juliette paused to watch the sun sink below
the distant horizon.&nbsp; Loo was walking a few paces behind her, and
when she stopped he stopped also.&nbsp; She sat down on the low wall,
but he remained standing.</p>
<p>Her profile, clear-cut and delicate with its short chin and beautifully
curved lips, its slightly aquiline nose and crisp hair rising in a bold
curve from her forehead, was outlined against the sky.&nbsp; He could
see the gleam of the western light in her eyes, which were half averted.&nbsp;
While she watched the sunset, he watched her with a puzzled expression
about his lips.</p>
<p>He remembered perhaps the Marquis&rsquo;s last words, that Juliette
was only a child.&nbsp; He knew that she could in all human calculation
know nothing of the world; that at least she could have learned nothing
of it in the convent where she had been educated.&nbsp; So, if she knew
anything, she must have known it before she went there, which was impossible.&nbsp;
She knew nothing, therefore, and yet she was not a child.&nbsp; As a
matter of fact, she was the most beautiful woman Loo Barebone had ever
seen.&nbsp; He was thinking that as she sat on the low wall, swinging
one slipper half falling from her foot, watching the sunset, while he
watched her and noted the anger slowly dying from her eyes as the light
faded from the sky.&nbsp; That strange anger went down, it would appear,
with the sun.&nbsp; After the long silence&mdash;when the low bars of
red cloud lying across the western sky were fading from pink to grey&mdash;she
spoke at last in a voice which he had never heard before, gentle and
confidential.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you going away?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he knew that the very hour of his departure was known to her
already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when will you come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can,&rdquo; he answered, half-involuntarily.&nbsp;
There was a turn of the head half toward him, something expectant in
the tilt at the corner of her parted lips, which made it practically
impossible to make any other answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, in little more than a whisper&mdash;then
she broke into a gay laugh and leapt off the wall.&nbsp; She walked
quickly past him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she repeated over her shoulder as she passed him.&nbsp;
And he was too quick for her, for he caught her hand and touched it
with his lips before she jerked it away from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are here,&rdquo; he answered, with a laugh.&nbsp;
But she was grave again and looked at him with a queer searching glance
before she turned away and left him standing in the half-light&mdash;thinking
of Miriam Liston.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.&nbsp; &ldquo;NINETEEN&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>As Juliette returned to the Gate House she encountered her father,
walking arm-in-arm with Dormer Colville.&nbsp; The presence of the Englishman
within the enceinte of the ch&acirc;teau was probably no surprise to
her, for she must have heard the clang of the bell just within the gate,
which could not be opened from outside; by which alone access was gained
to any part of the ch&acirc;teau.</p>
<p>Colville was in riding costume.&nbsp; It was, indeed, his habitual
dress when living in France, for he made no concealment of his partnership
in a well-known business house in Bordeaux.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a sleeping partner,&rdquo; he would say, with that easy
flow of egotistic confidence which is the surest way of learning somewhat
of your neighbour&rsquo;s private affairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a sleeping
partner at all times except the vintage, when I awake and ride round
among the growers, to test their growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too early yet for these journeys, for the grapes were hardly
ripe.&nbsp; But any one who wished to move from place to place must
needs do so in the saddle in a country where land is so valuable that
the width of a road is grudged, and bridle-ways are deemed good enough
for the passage of the long and narrow carts that carry wine.</p>
<p>Ever since their somewhat precipitate departure from the Villa Cordouan
at Royan, Dormer Colville and Barebone had been in company.&nbsp; They
had stayed together, in one friend&rsquo;s house or another.&nbsp; Sometimes
they enjoyed the hospitality of a ch&acirc;teau, and at others put up
with the scanty accommodation of a priest&rsquo;s house or the apartment
of a retired military officer, in one of those little towns of provincial
France at which the cheap journalists of Paris are pleased to sneer
without ceasing.</p>
<p>They avoided the large towns with extraordinary care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should we go to towns,&rdquo; asked Colville, jovially,
&ldquo;when we have business in the country and the sun is still high
in the sky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he would reply to the questions of an indiscreet
fellow-traveller, at table or on the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes; I am a
buyer of wine.&nbsp; We are buyers of wine.&nbsp; We are travelling
from place to place to watch the growth.&nbsp; For the wine is hidden
in the grape, and the grape is ripening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as often as not, the chance acquaintance of an inn d&eacute;jeuner
would catch the phrase and repeat it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! is that so?&rdquo; he would ask, with a sudden glance
at Dormer Colville&rsquo;s companion, who had hitherto passed unobserved
as the silent subordinate of a large buyer; learning his trade, no doubt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The grape is ripening.&nbsp; Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as sure as he seemed to be struck with this statement of a self-evident
fact, he would, in the next few minutes, bring the numeral &ldquo;nineteen&rdquo;&mdash;<i>tant
bien que mal</i>&mdash;into his conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With nineteen days of sun, the vintage will be upon us,&rdquo;
he would say; or, &ldquo;I have but nineteen kilometres more of road
before me to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, it frequently happened that the word came in very inappropriately,
as if tugged heroically to the front by a clumsy conversationalist.</p>
<p>There is no hazard of life so certain to discover sympathy or antagonism
as travel&mdash;a fact which points to the wisdom of beginning married
life with a journey.&nbsp; The majority of people like to know the worst
at once.&nbsp; To travel, however, with Dormer Colville was a liberal
education in the virtues.&nbsp; No man could be less selfish or less
easily fatigued; which are the two bases upon which rest all the stumbling-blocks
of travel.</p>
<p>Up to a certain point, Barebone and Dormer Colville became fast friends
during the month that elapsed between their departure from Mrs. St.
Pierre Lawrence&rsquo;s house and their arrival at the inn at Gemosac.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;White Horse,&rdquo; at Gemosac, was no better and no worse
than any other &ldquo;White Horse&rdquo; in any other small town of
France.&nbsp; It was, however, better than the principal inn of a town
of the same size in any other habitable part of the globe.</p>
<p>There were many reasons why the Marquis de Gemosac had yielded to
Colville&rsquo;s contention&mdash;that the time had not yet come for
Loo Barebone to be his guest at the ch&acirc;teau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is inclined to be indolent,&rdquo; Colville had whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One recognises, in many traits of character, the source from
whence his blood is drawn.&nbsp; He will not exert himself so long as
there is some one else at hand who is prepared to take trouble.&nbsp;
He must learn that it is necessary to act for himself.&nbsp; He needs
rousing.&nbsp; Let him travel through France, and see for himself that
of which he has as yet only learnt at second-hand.&nbsp; That will rouse
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the journey through the valleys of the Garonne and the Dordogne
had been undertaken.</p>
<p>Another, greater journey, was now afoot, to end at no less a centre
of political life than Paris.&nbsp; A start was to be made this evening,
and Dormer Colville now came to report that all was ready and the horses
at the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there were scenes such as this for all of us to linger
in, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, lifting his face to the western sky
and inhaling the scent of the flowers growing knee-deep all around him,
&ldquo;men would accomplish little in their brief lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes, dreamy and reflective, wandered over the scene and paused,
just for a moment in passing, on Juliette&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; She continued
her way, with no other answer than a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She grows, my dear Marquis&mdash;she grows every minute of
the day and wakes up a new woman every morning,&rdquo; said Colville,
in a confidential aside, and he went forward to meet Loo with his accustomed
laugh of good-fellowship.&nbsp; He whom the world calls a good fellow
is never a wise man.</p>
<p>Barebone walked toward the gate without joining in the talk of his
companions.&nbsp; He was thoughtful and uneasy.&nbsp; He had come to
say good-bye and nothing else.&nbsp; He was wondering if he had really
meant what he had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; interrupted Colville&rsquo;s smooth voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We must get into the saddle and begone.&nbsp; I was just telling
Monsieur and Mademoiselle Juliette, that any man might be tempted to
linger at Gemosac until the active years of a lifetime rolled by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis made the needful reply; hoping that he might yet live
to see Gemosac&mdash;and not only Gemosac, but a hundred ch&acirc;teaux
like it&mdash;reawakened to their ancient glory, and thrown open to
welcome the restorer of their fallen fortunes.</p>
<p>Colville looked from one to the other, and then, with his foot in
the stirrup, turned to look at Juliette, who had followed them to the
gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;will she wish us
good luck, also?&nbsp; Alas! those times are gone when we could have
asked for her ribbon to wear, and to fight for between ourselves when
we are tired and cross at the end of a journey.&nbsp; Come, Barebone&mdash;into
the saddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited, both looking at Juliette; for she had not spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you good luck,&rdquo; she said, at length, patting
the neck of Colville&rsquo;s horse, her face wearing a little mystic
smile.</p>
<p>Thus they departed, at sunset, on a journey of which old men will
still talk in certain parts of France.&nbsp; Here and there, in the
Angoumois, in Guienne, in the Vend&eacute;e, and in the western parts
of Brittany, the student of forgotten history may find an old priest
who will still persist in dividing France into the ancient provinces,
and will tell how Hope rode through the Royalist country when he himself
was busy at his first cure.</p>
<p>The journey lasted nearly two months, and before they passed north
of the Loire at Nantes and quitted the wine country, the vintage was
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must say that we are cider merchants, that is all,&rdquo;
observed Dormer Colville, when they crossed the river, which has always
been the great divider of France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sobering down.&nbsp; I believe he will become serious,&rdquo;
wrote he to the Marquis de Gemosac.&nbsp; But he took care to leave
Loo Barebone as free as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, in a way, a compulsory pilot,&rdquo; he explained, airily,
to his companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ship is yours, and you probably know
more about the shoals than I do.&nbsp; You must have felt that a hundred
times when you were at sea with that solemn old sailor, Captain Clubbe.&nbsp;
And yet, before you could get into port, you found yourself forced to
take the compulsory pilot on board and make him welcome with such grace
as you could command, feeling all the while that he did not want to
come and you could have done as well without him.&nbsp; So you must
put up with my company as gracefully as you can, remembering that you
can drop me as soon as you are in port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And surely, none other could have occupied an uncomfortable position
so gracefully.</p>
<p>Barebone found that he had not much to do.&nbsp; He soon accommodated
himself to a position which required nothing more active than a ready
ear and a gracious patience.&nbsp; For, day by day&mdash;almost hour
by hour&mdash;it was his lot to listen to protestations of loyalty to
a cause which smouldered none the less hotly because it was hidden from
the sight of the Prince President&rsquo;s spies.</p>
<p>And, as Colville had predicted, Barebone sobered down.&nbsp; He would
ride now, hour after hour, in silence, whereas at the beginning of the
journey he had talked gaily enough, seeing a hundred humorous incidents
in the passing events of the day; laughing at the recollection of an
interview with some provincial notable who had fallen behind the times,
or jesting readily enough with such as showed a turn for joking on the
road.</p>
<p>But now the unreality of his singular change of fortune was vanishing.&nbsp;
Every village priest who came after dark to take a glass of wine with
them at their inn sent it farther into the past, every provincial noble
greeting him on the step of his remote and quiet house added a note
to the drumming reality which dominated his waking moments and disturbed
his sleep at night.</p>
<p>Day by day they rode on, passing through two or three villages between
such halts as were needed by the horses.&nbsp; At every hamlet, in the
large villages, where they rested and had their food, at the remote
little town where they passed a night, there was always some one expecting
them, who came and talked of the weather and more or less skilfully
brought in the numeral nineteen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nineteen!&nbsp; Nineteen!&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was a watchword all over France.</p>
<p>Long before, on the banks of the Dordogne, Loo had asked his companion
why that word had been selected&mdash;what it meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means Louis XIX.,&rdquo; replied Dormer Colville, gravely.</p>
<p>And now, as they rode through a country so rural, so thinly populated
and remote that nothing like it may be found in these crowded islands,
the number seemed to follow them; or, rather, to pass on before them
and await their coming.</p>
<p>Often Colville would point silently with his whip to the numerals,
scrawled on a gate-post or written across a wall.&nbsp; At this time
France was mysteriously flooded with cheap portraits of the great Napoleon.&nbsp;
It was before the days of pictorial advertisement, and young ladies
who wished to make an advantageous marriage had no means of advertising
the fact and themselves in supplements to illustrated papers.&nbsp;
The walls of inns and shops and <i>diligence</i> offices were therefore
barer than they are to-day.&nbsp; And from these bare walls stared out
at this time the well-known face of the great Napoleon.&nbsp; It was
an innovation, and as such readily enough accepted.</p>
<p>At every fair, at the great f&ecirc;te of St. Jean, at St. Jean d&rsquo;Ang&eacute;ly
and a hundred other f&ecirc;tes of purely local notoriety, at least
one hawker of cheap lithographs was to be found.&nbsp; And if the buyer
haggled, he could get the portrait of the great Emperor for almost nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One cannot print it at such a cost,&rdquo; the seller assured
his purchasers, which was no less than the truth.</p>
<p>The fairs were, and are to this day, the link between the remoter
villages and the world; and the peasants carried home with them a picture,
for the first time, to hang on their walls.&nbsp; Thus the Prince President
fostered the Napoleonic legend.</p>
<p>Dormer Colville would walk up to these pictures, and, as often as
not, would turn and look over his shoulder at Barebone, with a short
laugh.&nbsp; For as often as not, the numerals were scrawled across
the face in pencil.</p>
<p>But Barebone had ceased to laugh at the constant repetition now.&nbsp;
Soon Colville ceased to point out the silent witness, for he perceived
that Loo was looking for it himself, detecting its absence with a gleam
of determination in his eyes or noting its recurrence with a sharp sigh,
as of the consciousness of a great responsibility.</p>
<p>Thus the reality was gradually forced upon him that that into which
he had entered half in jest was no jest at all; that he was moving forward
on a road which seemed easy enough, but of which the end was not perceptible;
neither was there any turning to one side or the other.</p>
<p>All men who have made a mark&mdash;whether it be a guiding or warning
sign to those that follow&mdash;must at one moment of their career have
perceived their road before them, thus.&nbsp; Each must have realised
that once set out upon that easy path there is no turning aside and
no turning back.&nbsp; And many have chosen to turn back while there
was yet time, leaving the mark unmade.&nbsp; For most men are cowards
and shun responsibility.&nbsp; Most men unconsciously steer their way
by proverb or catchword; and all the wise saws of all the nations preach
cowardice.</p>
<p>Barebone saw his road now, and Dormer Colville knew that he saw it.</p>
<p>When they crossed the Loire they passed the crisis, and Colville
breathed again like one who had held his breath for long.&nbsp; Those
colder, sterner men of Brittany, who, in later times, compared notes
with the nobles of Guienne and the Vend&eacute;e, seemed to talk of
a different man; for they spoke of one who rarely laughed, and never
turned aside from a chosen path which was in no wise bordered by flowers.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.&nbsp; NO. 8 RUELLE ST. JACOB</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Between the Rue de Lille and the Boulevard St. Germain, in the narrow
streets which to this day have survived the sweeping influence of Baron
Haussmann, once Prefect of the Seine, there are many houses which scarcely
seem to have opened door or window since the great Revolution.</p>
<p>One of these, to be precise, is situated in the Ruelle St. Jacob,
hardly wider than a lane&mdash;a short street with a blind end against
high walls&mdash;into which any vehicle that enters must needs do so
with the knowledge of having to back out again.&nbsp; For there is no
room to turn.&nbsp; Which is an allegory.&nbsp; All the windows, in
fact, that look forlornly at the blank walls or peep over the high gateways
into the Ruelle St. Jacob are Royalist windows looking into a street
which is blinded by a high wall and is too narrow to allow of turning.</p>
<p>Many of the windows would appear to have gathered dust since those
days more than a hundred years ago when white faces peeped from them
and trembling hands unbarred the sash to listen to the roar of voices
in the Rue du Bac, in the open space by the church of St. Germain des
Pr&egrave;s, in the Cit&eacute;, all over Paris, where the people were
making history.</p>
<p>To this house in the Ruelle St. Jacob, Dormer Colville and Loo Barebone
made their way on foot, on their arrival in Paris at the termination
of their long journey.</p>
<p>It was nearly dark, for Colville had arranged to approach the city
and leave their horses at a stable at Meudon after dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is foolish,&rdquo; he said, gaily, to his companion, &ldquo;to
flaunt a face like yours in Paris by daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had driven from Meudon in a hired carriage to the corner of
the Champ de Mars, in those days still innocent of glass houses and
exhibition buildings, for Paris was not yet the toy-shop of the world;
and from the Champ de Mars they came on foot through the ill-paved,
feebly lighted streets.&nbsp; In the Ruelle St. Jacob itself there was
only one lamp, burning oil, swinging at the corner.&nbsp; The remainder
of the lane depended for its illumination on the windows of two small
shops retailing firewood and pickled gherkins and balls of string grey
with age, as do all the shops in the narrow streets on the wrong side
of the Seine.</p>
<p>Dormer Colville led the way, picking his steps from side to side
of the gutter which meandered odoriferously down the middle of the street
toward the river.&nbsp; He stopped in front of the great gateway and
looked up at the arch of it, where the stone carving had been carefully
obliterated by some enthusiastic citizen armed with a hatchet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ichabod,&rdquo; he said, with a short laugh; and cautiously
laid hold of the dangling bell-handle which had summoned the porter
to open to a Queen in those gay days when Marie Antoinette light-heartedly
pushed a falling monarchy down the incline.</p>
<p>The great gate was not opened in response, but a small side door,
deep-sunken in the thickness of the wall.&nbsp; On either jamb of the
door was affixed in the metal letters ordained by the municipality the
number eight.&nbsp; Number Eight Ruelle St. Jacob had once been known
to kings as the Hotel Gemosac.</p>
<p>The man who opened carried a lantern and held the door ajar with
a grudging hand while he peered out.&nbsp; One could almost imagine
that he had survived the downfall and the Restoration, and a couple
of republics, behind the high walls.</p>
<p>The court-yard was paved with round cobble-stones no bigger than
an apple, and, even by the flickering light of the lantern, it was perceptible
that no weed had been allowed to grow between the stones or in the seams
of the wide, low steps that led to an open door.</p>
<p>The house appeared to be dark and deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur le Marquis&mdash;Monsieur le Marquis is at home,&rdquo;
muttered the man with a bronchial chuckle, and led the way across the
yard.&nbsp; He wore a sort of livery, which must have been put away
for years.&nbsp; A young man had been measured for the coat which now
displayed three deep creases across a bent back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention&mdash;attention!&rdquo; he said, in a warning voice,
while he scraped a sulphur match in the hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are
holes in the carpets.&nbsp; It is easy to trip and fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lighted the candle, and after having carefully shut and bolted
the door, he led the way upstairs.&nbsp; At their approach, easily audible
in the empty house by reason of the hollow creaking of the oak floor,
a door was opened at the head of the stairs and a flood of light met
the new-comers.</p>
<p>In the doorway, which was ten feet high, the little bent form of
the Marquis de Gemosac stood waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; he said, with that pleasant manner of his generation,
which was refined and spirituelle and sometimes dramatic, and yet ever
failed to touch aught but the surface of life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! ah!&nbsp;
Safely accomplished&mdash;the great journey.&nbsp; Safely accomplished.&nbsp;
You permit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he embraced Barebone after the custom of his day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From all sides,&rdquo; he said, when the door was closed,
&ldquo;I hear that you have done great things.&nbsp; From every quarter
one hears your praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held him at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your face is graver and&mdash;more
striking in resemblance than ever.&nbsp; So now you know&mdash;now you
have seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Barebone, gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
seen and I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis rubbed his white hands together and gave a little crackling
laugh of delight as he drew forward a chair to the fire, which was of
logs as long as a barrel.&nbsp; The room was a huge one, and it was
lighted from end to end with lamps, as if for a reception or a ball.&nbsp;
The air was damp and mouldly.&nbsp; There were patches of grey on the
walls, which had once been painted with garlands of roses and Cupids
and pastoral scenes by a noted artist of the Great Age.</p>
<p>The ceiling had fallen in places, and the woodwork of the carved
furniture gave forth a subtle scent of dry rot.</p>
<p>But everything was in an exquisite taste which vulgarer generations
have never yet succeeded in imitating.&nbsp; Nothing was concealed,
but rather displayed with a half-cynical pride.&nbsp; All was moth-ridden,
worm-eaten, fallen to decay&mdash;but it was of the Monarchy.&nbsp;
Not half a dozen houses in Paris, where already the wealth, which has
to-day culminated in a ridiculous luxury of outward show, was beginning
to build new palaces, could show room after room furnished in the days
of the Great Louis.&nbsp; The very air, faintly scented it would seem
by some forgotten perfume, breathed of a bygone splendour.&nbsp; And
the last of the de Gemosacs scorned to screen his poverty from the eyes
of his equals, nor sought to hide from them a desolation which was only
symbolic of that which crushed their hearts and bade them steal back
from time to time like criminals to the capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said to Colville and Barebone, &ldquo;I
have kept my promise, I have thrown open this old house once more for
to-night&rsquo;s meeting.&nbsp; You will find that many friends have
made the journey to Paris for the occasion&mdash;Madame de Chantonnay
and Albert, Madame de Rathe and many from the Vend&eacute;e and the
West whom you have met on your journey.&nbsp; And to-night one may speak
without fear, for none will be present who are not vouched for by the
Almanac de Gotha.&nbsp; There are no Royalists <i>pour rire</i> or <i>pour
vivre</i> to-night.&nbsp; You have but time to change your clothes and
dine.&nbsp; Your luggage arrived yesterday.&nbsp; You will forgive the
stupidity of old servants who have forgotten their business.&nbsp; Come,
I will lead the way and show you your rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a candle and did the honours of the deserted dust-ridden
house in the manner of the high calling which had been his twenty years
ago when Charles X. was king.&nbsp; For some there lingers a certain
pathos in the sight of a belated survival, while the majority of men
and women are ready to smile at it instead.&nbsp; And yet the Monarchy
lasted eight centuries and the Revolution eight years.&nbsp; Perhaps
Fate may yet exact payment for the excesses of those eight years from
a nation for which the watching world already prepares a secondary place
in the councils of empire.</p>
<p>The larger room had been assigned to Loo.&nbsp; There was a subtle
difference in the Marquis&rsquo;s manner toward him.&nbsp; He made an
odd bow as he quitted the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Colville, whose room communicated with
this great apartment by a dressing-room and two doors.&nbsp; He spoke
in English, as they always did when they were alone together.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&mdash;you are launched.&nbsp; You are <i>lanc&eacute;</i>,
my friend.&nbsp; I may say you are through the shoals now and out on
the high seas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, candle in hand, and looked round the room with a reflective
smile.&nbsp; It was obviously the best room in the house, with a fireplace
as wide as a gate, where logs of pine burnt briskly on high iron dogs.&nbsp;
The bed loomed mysteriously in one corner with its baldachin of Gobelin
tapestry.&nbsp; Here, too, the dim scent of fallen monarchy lingered
in the atmosphere.&nbsp; A portrait of Louis XVI. in a faded frame hung
over the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the time will come,&rdquo; pursued Colville, with his
melancholy, sympathetic smile, &ldquo;when you will find it necessary
to drop the pilot&mdash;to turn your face seaward and your back upon
old recollections and old associations.&nbsp; You cannot make an omelette
without breaking eggs, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; replied Barebone, with a brisk movement of
the head, &ldquo;I shall have to forget Farlingford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville had moved toward the door that led to his own room.&nbsp;
He paused, examining the wick of the candle he carried in his hand.&nbsp;
Then, though glib of speech, he decided in favour of silence, and went
away without making reply.</p>
<p>Loo sat down in a grey old arm-chair in front of the fire.&nbsp;
The house was astoundingly noiseless, though situated in what had once
been the heart of Paris.&nbsp; It was one of the few houses left in
this quarter with a large garden.&nbsp; And the traffic passing in and
out of the Ruelle St. Jacob went slipshod on its own feet.&nbsp; The
busy crackle of the wood was the only sound to break a silence which
seemed part of this vast palace of memories.</p>
<p>Loo had ridden far and was tired.&nbsp; He smiled grimly at the fire.&nbsp;
It is to be supposed that he was sitting down to the task he had set
himself&mdash;to forget Farlingford.</p>
<p>There was a great reception at the Hotel Gemosac that night, and
after twenty years of brooding silence the rooms, hastily set in order,
were lighted up.</p>
<p>There was, as the Marquis had promised, no man or woman present who
was not vouched for by a noble name or by history.&nbsp; As the old
man presented them, their names were oddly familiar to the ear, while
each face looking at Loo seemed to be the face of a ghost looking out
of a past which the world will never forget so long as history lives.</p>
<p>And here, again, was the subtle difference.&nbsp; They no longer
talked to Loo, but stood apart and spoke among themselves in a hushed
voice.&nbsp; Men made their bow to him and met his smile with grave
and measuring eyes.&nbsp; Some made a little set speech, which might
mean much or nothing.&nbsp; Others embarked on such a speech and paused&mdash;faltered,
and passed on gulping something down in their throats.</p>
<p>Women made a deep reverence to him and glanced at him with parted
lips and white faces&mdash;no coquetry in their eyes.&nbsp; They saw
that he was young and good-looking; but they forgot that he might think
the same of them.&nbsp; Then they passed on and grouped themselves together,
as women do in moments of danger or emotion, their souls instinctively
seeking the company of other souls tuned to catch a hundred passing
vibrations of the heart-strings of which men remain in ignorance.&nbsp;
They spoke together in lowered voices without daring, or desiring perhaps,
to turn and look at him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It only remains,&rdquo; some one said, &ldquo;for the Duchesse
d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me to recognise his claim.&nbsp; A messenger has
departed for Frohsdorf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Barebone, looking at them, knew that there was a barrier between
him and them which none could cast aside: a barrier erected in the past
and based on the sure foundations of history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is an old woman,&rdquo; said Monsieur de Gemosac to any
who spoke to him on this subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is seventy-two, and
fifty-eight of those years have been marked by greater misfortunes than
ever fell to the lot of a woman.&nbsp; When she came out of prison she
had no tears left, my friends.&nbsp; We cannot expect her to turn back
willingly to the past now.&nbsp; But we know that in her heart she has
never been sure that her brother died in the Temple.&nbsp; You know
how many disappointments she has had.&nbsp; We must not awake her sleeping
sorrow until all is ready.&nbsp; I shall make the journey to Frohsdorf&mdash;that
I promise you.&nbsp; But to-night we have another task before us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; answered his listeners.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are to open the locket.&nbsp; Where is it?&mdash;show it to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the locket which Captain Clubbe&rsquo;s wife had given to Dormer
Colville was handed from one to another.&nbsp; It was not of great value,
but it was of gold with stones, long since discoloured, set in silver
around it.&nbsp; It was crushed and misshapen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has never been opened for twenty years,&rdquo; they told
each other.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has been mislaid in an obscure village in
England for nearly half a century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Vicomte de Castel Aunet&mdash;who is so clever a mechanician&mdash;has
promised to bring his tools,&rdquo; said Monsieur de Gemosac.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He will open it for us&mdash;even if he find it necessary to
break the locket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the thing went round the room until it came to Loo Barebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen it before,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
I remember seeing it long ago&mdash;when I was a little child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he handed it to the old Vicomte de Castel Aunet, whose shaking
fingers closed round it in a breathless silence.&nbsp; He carried it
to the table, and some one brought candles.&nbsp; The Vicomte was very
old.&nbsp; He had learnt clock-making, they said, in prison during the
Terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Il n&rsquo;y a moyen</i>,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I must break it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one effort he prised up the cover, but the hinge snapped, and
the lid rolled across the table into Barebone&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, in that breathless silence, &ldquo;now
I remember it.&nbsp; I remember the red silk lining of the cover, and
in the other side there is the portrait of a lady with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vicomte paused, with his palm covering the other half of the
locket and looked across at Loo.&nbsp; And the eyes of all Royalist
France were fixed on the same face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; whispered Dormer Colville in English, crushing
Barebone&rsquo;s foot under the table.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.&nbsp; DROPPING THE PILOT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;The portrait of a lady,&rdquo; repeated Loo, slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Young and beautiful.&nbsp; That much I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old nobleman had never removed his covering hand from the locket.&nbsp;
He had never glanced at it himself.&nbsp; He looked slowly round the
peering faces, two and three deep round the table.&nbsp; He was the
oldest man present&mdash;one of the oldest in Paris&mdash;one of the
few now living who had known Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p>Without uncovering the locket, he handed it to Barebone across the
table with a bow worthy of the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i> and his own
historic name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is right that you should be the first to see it,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since there is no longer any doubt that the lady
was your father&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loo took the locket, looked at it with strangely glittering eyes
and steady lips.&nbsp; He gave a sort of gasp, which all in the room
heard.&nbsp; He was handing it back to the Vicomte de Castel Aunet without
a word of comment, when a crashing fall on the bare floor startled every
one.&nbsp; A lady had fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; muttered Dormer Colville almost in Barebone&rsquo;s
ear and swayed against him.&nbsp; Barebone turned and looked into a
face grey and haggard, and shining with perspiration.&nbsp; Instinctively
he grasped him by the arm and supported him.&nbsp; In the confusion
of the moment no one noticed Colville; for all were pressing round the
prostrate lady.&nbsp; And in a moment Colville was himself again, though
the ready smile sat oddly on such white lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake be careful,&rdquo; he said, and turned
away, handkerchief in hand.</p>
<p>For the moment the portrait was forgotten until the lady was on her
feet again, smiling reassurances and rubbing her elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;nothing.&nbsp; My heart&mdash;that
is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she staggered to a chair with the reassuring smile frozen on
her face.</p>
<p>Then the portrait was passed from hand to hand in silence.&nbsp;
It was a miniature of Marie Antoinette, painted on ivory, which had
turned yellow.&nbsp; The colours were almost lost, but the face stood
clearly enough.&nbsp; It was the face of a young girl, long and narrow,
with the hair drawn straight up and dressed high and simply on the head
without ornament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is she,&rdquo; said one and another.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est
bien elle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was painted when she was newly a queen,&rdquo; commented
the Vicomte de Castel Aunet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have seen others like it,
but not that one before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone stood apart and no one offered to approach him.&nbsp; Dormer
Colville had gone toward the great fireplace, and was standing by himself
there with his back toward the room.&nbsp; He was surreptitiously wiping
from his face the perspiration which had suddenly run down it, as one
may see the rain running down the face of a statue.</p>
<p>Things had taken an unexpected turn.&nbsp; The Marquis de Gemosac,
himself always on the surface, had stirred others more deeply than he
had anticipated or could now understand.&nbsp; France has always been
the victim of her own emotions; aroused in the first instance half in
idleness, allowed to swell with a semi-restraining laugh, and then suddenly
sweeping and overwhelming.&nbsp; History tells of a hundred such crises
in the pilgrimage of the French people.&nbsp; A few more&mdash;and historians
shall write &ldquo;Ichabod&rdquo; across the most favoured land in Europe.</p>
<p>It is customary to relate that, after a crisis, those most concerned
in it know not how they faced it or what events succeeded it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He never knew,&rdquo; we are informed, &ldquo;how he got through
the rest of the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loo Barebone knew and remembered every incident, every glance.&nbsp;
He was in full possession of every faculty, and never had each been
so keenly alive to the necessity of the moment.&nbsp; Never had his
quick brain been so alert as it was during the rest of the evening.&nbsp;
And those who had come to the Hotel Gemosac to confirm their adoption
of a figure-head went away with the startling knowledge in their hearts
that they had never in the course of an artificial life met a man less
suited to play that undignified part.</p>
<p>And all the while, in the back of his mind, there lingered with a
deadly patience the desire for the moment which must inevitably come
when he should at last find himself alone, face to face, with Dormer
Colville.</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight before this moment came.&nbsp; At last the
latest guest had taken his leave, quitting the house by the garden door
and making his way across that forlorn and weedy desert by the dim light
reflected from the clouds above.&nbsp; At last the Marquis de Gemosac
had bidden them good night, and they were left alone in the vast bedroom
which a dozen candles, in candelabras of silver blackened by damp and
neglect, only served to render more gloomy and mysterious.</p>
<p>In the confusion consequent on the departure of so many guests the
locket had been lost sight of, and Monsieur de Gemosac forgot to make
inquiry for it.&nbsp; It was in Barebone&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>Colville put together with the toe of his boot the logs which were
smouldering in a glow of incandescent heat.&nbsp; He turned and glanced
over his shoulder toward his companion.</p>
<p>Barebone was taking the locket from his waistcoat pocket and approaching
the table where the candles burnt low in their sockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never really supposed you were the man, did you?&rdquo;
asked Colville, with a ready smile.&nbsp; He was brave, at all events,
for he took the only course left to him with a sublime assurance.</p>
<p>Barebone looked across the candles at the face which smiled, and
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I thought,&rdquo; he answered, with a queer laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not jump to any hasty decisions,&rdquo; urged Colville
instantly, as if warned by the laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; I want to sift the matter carefully to the bottom.&nbsp;
It will be interesting to learn who are the deceived and who the deceivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone had had time to think out a course of action.&nbsp; His
face seemed to puzzle Colville, who was rarely at fault in such judgments
of character as came within his understanding.&nbsp; But he seemed for
an instant to be on the threshold of something beyond his understanding;
and yet he had lived, almost day and night, for some months with Barebone.&nbsp;
Since the beginning&mdash;that far-off beginning at Farlingford&mdash;their
respective positions had been quite clearly defined.&nbsp; Colville,
the elder by nearly twenty years, had always been the guide and mentor
and friend&mdash;the compulsory pilot he had gaily called himself.&nbsp;
He had a vast experience of the world.&nbsp; He had always moved in
the best French society.&nbsp; All that he knew, all the influence he
could command, and the experience upon which he could draw were unreservedly
at Barebone&rsquo;s service.&nbsp; The difference in years had only
affected their friendship in so far as it defined their respective positions
and prohibited any thought of rivalry.&nbsp; Colville had been the unquestioned
leader, Barebone the ready disciple.</p>
<p>And now in the twinkling of an eye the positions were reversed.&nbsp;
Colville stood watching Barebone&rsquo;s face with eyes rendered almost
servile by a great suspense.&nbsp; He waited breathless for the next
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This portrait,&rdquo; said Barebone, &ldquo;of the Queen was
placed in the locket by you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville nodded with a laugh of conscious cleverness rewarded by
complete success.&nbsp; There was nothing in his companion&rsquo;s voice
to suggest suppressed anger.&nbsp; It was all right after all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had great difficulty in finding just what I wanted,&rdquo;
he added, modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I remember&mdash;though the memory is necessarily vague&mdash;was
a portrait of a woman older than this.&nbsp; Her style of dress was
more elaborate.&nbsp; Her hair was dressed differently, with sort of
curls at the side, and on the top, half buried in the hair, was the
imitation of a nest&mdash;a dove&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; Such a thing would
naturally stick in a child&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; It stuck in mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and nearly gave the game away to-night,&rdquo; said
Colville, gulping down the memory of those tense moments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That portrait&mdash;the original&mdash;you have not
destroyed it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no.&nbsp; It is of some value,&rdquo; replied Colville,
almost naively.&nbsp; He felt in his pocket and produced a silver cigar
case.&nbsp; The miniature was wrapped in a piece of thin paper, which
he unfolded.&nbsp; Barebone took the painting and examined it with a
little nod of recognition.&nbsp; His memory had not failed after twenty
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this lady?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Dormer Colville hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the history of that period?&rdquo; he inquired,
after a moment&rsquo;s reflection.&nbsp; For the last hour he had been
trying to decide on a course of conduct.&nbsp; During the last few minutes
he had been forced to change it half a dozen times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Septimus Marvin, of Farlingford, is one of the greatest living
authorities on those reigns.&nbsp; I learnt a good deal from him,&rdquo;
was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lady is, I think, the Duchesse de Guiche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even Marvin could not tell you for certain,&rdquo; replied
Colville, mildly.&nbsp; He did not seem to perceive a difference in
Barebone&rsquo;s manner toward himself.&nbsp; The quickest intelligence
cannot follow another&rsquo;s mind beyond its own depth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the inference is that my father was the illegitimate
son of the Comte d&rsquo;Artois.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterward Charles X., of France,&rdquo; supplemented Colville,
significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the inference?&rdquo; persisted Barebone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should like to know your opinion.&nbsp; You must have studied the question
very carefully.&nbsp; Your opinion should be of some interest, though&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though&mdash;&rdquo; echoed Colville, interrogatively, and
regretted it immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though it is impossible to say when you speak the truth and
when you lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And any who doubted that there was royal blood in Loo Barebone&rsquo;s
veins would assuredly have been satisfied by a glance at his face at
that moment; by the sound of his quiet, judicial voice; by the sudden
and almost terrifying sense of power in his measuring eyes.</p>
<p>Colville turned away with an awkward laugh and gave his attention
to the logs on the hearth.&nbsp; Then suddenly he regained his readiness
of speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Barebone,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must
not quarrel; we cannot afford to do that.&nbsp; And after all, what
does it matter?&nbsp; You are only giving yourself the benefit of the
doubt&mdash;that is all.&nbsp; For there is a doubt.&nbsp; You may be
what you&mdash;what we say you are, after all.&nbsp; It is certain enough
that Marie Antoinette and Fersen were in daily correspondence.&nbsp;
They were both clever&mdash;two of the cleverest people in France&mdash;and
they were both desperate.&nbsp; Remember that.&nbsp; Do you think that
they would have failed in a matter of such intense interest to her,
and therefore to him?&nbsp; All these pretenders, Naundorff and the
others, have proved that quite clearly, but none has succeeded in proving
that he was the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think that I shall be able to prove that I am the
man&mdash;when I am not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By way of reply Dormer Colville turned again to the fireplace and
took down the print of Louis XVI. engraved from a portrait painted when
he was still Dauphin.&nbsp; A mirror stood near, and Colville came to
the table carrying the portrait in one hand, the looking-glass in the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at one and
then at the other.&nbsp; Look in the mirror and then at the portrait.&nbsp;
Prove it!&nbsp; Why, God has proved it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think we had better bring Him into the question,&rdquo;
was the retort: an odd reflex of Captain Clubbe&rsquo;s solid East Anglian
piety.&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&nbsp; If we go on with the thing at all, let
us be honest enough to admit to ourselves that we are dishonest.&nbsp;
The portrait in that locket points clearly enough to the Truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The portrait in that locket is of Marie Antoinette,&rdquo;
replied Colville, half sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And no one can ever prove
anything contrary to that.&nbsp; No one except myself knows of&mdash;of
this doubt which you have stumbled upon.&nbsp; De Gemosac, Parson Marvin,
Clubbe&mdash;all of them are convinced that your father was the Dauphin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Miss Liston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miriam Liston&mdash;she also, of course.&nbsp; And I believe
she knew it long before I told her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone turned and looked at him squarely in the eyes.&nbsp; Colville
wondered a second time why Loo Barebone reminded him of Captain Clubbe
to-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you believe that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; But that isn&rsquo;t the question.&nbsp;
The question is about the future.&nbsp; You see how things are in France.&nbsp;
It is a question of Louis Napoleon or a monarchy&mdash;you see that.&nbsp;
Unless you stop him he will be Emperor before a year is out, and he
will drag France in the gutter.&nbsp; He is less a Bonaparte than you
are a Bourbon.&nbsp; You remember that Louis Bonaparte himself was the
first to say so.&nbsp; He wrote a letter to the Pope, saying so quite
clearly.&nbsp; You will go on with it, of course, Barebone.&nbsp; Say
you will go on with it!&nbsp; To turn back now would be death.&nbsp;
We could not do it if we wanted to.&nbsp; I have been trying to think
about it, and I cannot.&nbsp; That is the truth.&nbsp; It takes one&rsquo;s
breath away.&nbsp; At the mere thought of it I feel as if I were getting
out of my depth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been out of our depths the last month,&rdquo; admitted
Barebone, curtly.</p>
<p>And he stood reflecting, while Colville watched him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I go on,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;I go on alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not,&rdquo; urged Colville, with a laugh of great relief.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For you would always have me and my knowledge hanging over you.&nbsp;
If you succeeded, you would have me dunning you for hush-money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which seemed true enough.&nbsp; Few men knew more of one side of
human nature than Dormer Colville, it would appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can never tell,&rdquo; laughed Colville, but his laugh
rather paled under Barebone&rsquo;s glance.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can never
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise men do not attempt to blackmail&mdash;kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Colville caught his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; he admitted, after a pause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You seem to be taking to the position very kindly, Barebone.&nbsp;
But I do not mind, you know.&nbsp; It does not matter what we say to
each other, eh?&nbsp; We have been good friends so long.&nbsp; You must
do as you like.&nbsp; And if you succeed, I must be content to leave
my share of the matter to your consideration.&nbsp; You certainly seem
to know the business already, and some day perhaps you will remember
who taught you to be a King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an old North Sea skipper who taught me that,&rdquo;
replied Barebone.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is one of the things I learnt at
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; agreed Colville, almost nervously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you will go on with the thing, will you not?&nbsp; Like a
good fellow, eh?&nbsp; Think about it till to-morrow morning.&nbsp;
I will go now.&nbsp; Which is my candle?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; You will think
about it.&nbsp; Do not jump to any hasty decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried to the door as he spoke.&nbsp; He could not understand
Barebone at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do go on with it,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;it will
not be in response to any of your arguments.&nbsp; It will be only and
solely for the sake of France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;of course,&rdquo; agreed Colville, and closed the
door behind him.</p>
<p>In his own room he turned and looked toward the door leading through
to that from which he had hurriedly escaped.&nbsp; He passed his hand
across his face, which was white and moist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the sake of France!&rdquo; he echoed in bewilderment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For the sake of France!&nbsp; Gad! I believe he <i>is</i> the
man after all.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.&nbsp; A SIMPLE BANKER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Mr. John Turner had none of the outward signs of the discreet adviser
in his person or surroundings.&nbsp; He had, it was currently whispered,
inherited from his father an enormous <i>client&egrave;le</i> of noble
names.&nbsp; And to such as have studied the history of Paris during
the whole of the nineteenth century, it will appear readily comprehensible
that the careful or the penniless should give preference to an English
banker.</p>
<p>Mr. Turner&rsquo;s appearance suggested solidity, and the carpet
of his private room was a good one.&nbsp; The room smelt of cigar smoke,
while the office, through which the client must pass to reach it, was
odoriferous of ancient ledgers.</p>
<p>Half a dozen clerks were seated in the office, which was simply furnished
and innocent of iron safes.&nbsp; If a client entered, one of the six,
whose business it was, looked up, while the other five continued to
give their attention to the books before them.</p>
<p>One cold morning, toward the end of the year, Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence
was admitted by the concierge.&nbsp; She noted that only one clerk gave
heed to her entry, and, it is to be presumed, the quiet perfection of
her furs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the six young men in your office,&rdquo; she observed,
when she was seated in the bare wooden chair placed invitingly by the
side of John Turner&rsquo;s writing-table, &ldquo;only one appears to
be in full possession of his senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turner, sitting&mdash;if the expression be allowed&mdash;in a heap
in an armchair before a table provided with pens, ink, and a blotting-pad,
but otherwise bare, looked at his client with a bovine smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pay them to admire my clients,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mademoiselle de Montijo came in, I suppose the other five
would not look up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Turner settled himself a little lower into his chair, so that
he appeared to be in some danger of slipping under the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Archangel Gabriel came in, they would still attend
to their business,&rdquo; he replied, in his thick, slow voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He is not one of my clients.&nbsp;
Quite the contrary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence smoothed the fur that bordered her neat
jacket and glanced sideways at her banker.&nbsp; Then she looked round
the room.&nbsp; It was bare enough.&nbsp; A single picture hung on the
wall&mdash;a portrait of an old lady.&nbsp; Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence
raised her eyebrows, and continued her scrutiny.&nbsp; Here, again,
was no iron safe.&nbsp; There were no ledgers, no diaries, no note-books,
no paraphernalia of business.&nbsp; Nothing but a bare table and John
Turner seated at it, in a much more comfortable chair than that provided
for the client, staring apathetically at a date-case which stood on
a bare mantelpiece.</p>
<p>The lady&rsquo;s eyes returned to the portrait on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You used to have a portrait of Louis Philippe there,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Louis Philippe was on the throne,&rdquo; admitted the
banker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; inquired this daughter of Eve, looking at
the portrait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My maternal aunt,&rdquo; replied Turner, making a gesture
with two fingers, as if introducing his client to the portrait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep her, one may suppose, as a stop-gap&mdash;between
the dynasties.&nbsp; It is so safe&mdash;a maternal aunt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One cannot hang a republic on the wall, however much one may
want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are a Royalist?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am only a banker,&rdquo; replied Turner, with his chin
sinking lower on his bulging waistcoat and his eyes scarcely visible
beneath the heavy lids.</p>
<p>The remark, coupled with a thought that Turner was going to sleep,
seemed to remind the client of her business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly ask one of your clerks to let me know how
much money I have?&rdquo; she said, casting a glance not wholly innocent
of scornful reproach at the table, so glaringly devoid of the bare necessities
of a banking business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only eleven thousand francs and fourteen sous,&rdquo; replied
Turner, with a promptness which seemed to suggest that he kept no diary
or note-book on the table before him because he had need of neither.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure I must have more than that,&rdquo; said Mrs. St.
Pierre Lawrence, with some spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I quite thought I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But John Turner only moistened his lips and sat patiently gazing
at the date.&nbsp; His attitude dimly suggested&mdash;quite in a nice
way&mdash;that the chair upon which Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence sat was
polished bright by the garments of persons who had found themselves
labouring under the same error.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must have a hundred thousand francs to-morrow; that
is all.&nbsp; Simply must.&nbsp; And in notes, too.&nbsp; I told you
I should want it when you came to see me at Royan.&nbsp; You must remember.&nbsp;
I told you at luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we were eating a sweetbread <i>aux champignons</i>.&nbsp;
I remember perfectly.&nbsp; We do not get sweetbreads like that in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And John Turner shook his head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, will you let me have the money to-morrow morning&mdash;in
notes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember I advised you not to sell just now; after we had
finished the sweetbread and had gone on to a <i>cr&ecirc;me renvers&eacute;e</i>&mdash;very
good one, too.&nbsp; Yes, it is a bad time to sell.&nbsp; Things are
uncertain in France just now.&nbsp; One cannot even get one&rsquo;s
meals properly served.&nbsp; Cook&rsquo;s head is full of politics,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning&mdash;in notes,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. St.
Pierre Lawrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, your man at Royan was excellent&mdash;kept his head all
through&mdash;and a light hand, too.&nbsp; Got him with you in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have not.&nbsp; To-morrow morning, about ten o&rsquo;clock&mdash;in
notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence tapped a neat gloved finger on the corner
of the table with some determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember&mdash;at dessert&mdash;you told me you wanted to
realise a considerable sum of money at the beginning of the year, to
put into some business venture.&nbsp; Is this part of that sum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the lady, arranging her veil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A venture of Dormer Colville&rsquo;s, I think you told me&mdash;while
we were having coffee.&nbsp; One never gets coffee hot enough in a private
house, but yours was all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; mumbled Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, behind her quick
finger, busy with the veil.</p>
<p>Beneath the sleepy lids John Turner&rsquo;s eyes, which were small
and deep-sunken in the flesh, like the eyes of a pig, noted in passing
that his client&rsquo;s cheeks were momentarily pink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that there is anything
unsafe in Mr. Colville as a business man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; ejaculated Turner.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the
contrary, he is most enterprising.&nbsp; And I know no one who smokes
a better cigar than Colville&mdash;when he can get it.&nbsp; And the
young fellow seemed nice enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which young fellow?&rdquo; inquired the lady, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His young friend&mdash;the man who was with him.&nbsp; I think
you told me, after luncheon, that Colville required the money to start
his young friend in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; laughed Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, who, if she
felt momentarily uneasy, was quickly reassured.&nbsp; For this was one
of those fortunate ladies who go through life with the comforting sense
of being always cleverer than their neighbour.&nbsp; If the neighbour
happen to be a man, and a stout one, the conviction is the stronger
for those facts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never!&nbsp; I never told you that.&nbsp;
You must have dreamt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I did,&rdquo; admitted the banker, placidly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am afraid I often feel sleepy after luncheon.&nbsp; Perhaps
I dreamt it.&nbsp; But I could not hand such a sum in notes to an unprotected
lady, even if I can effect a sale of your securities so quickly as to
have the money ready by to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Perhaps Colville will
call for it himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one is in Paris now,&rdquo; was Mr. Turner&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And if he likes to bring his young friend with him, all the better.&nbsp;
In these uncertain times it is not fair on a man to hand to him a large
sum of money in notes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused and jerked his thumb toward
the window, which was a double one, looking down into the Rue Lafayette.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There are always people in the streets watching those who pass
in and out of a bank.&nbsp; If a man comes out smiling, with his hand
on his pocket, he is followed, and if an opportunity occurs, he is robbed.&nbsp;
Better not have it in notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, not troubling
further to deceive one so lethargic and simple, &ldquo;I know that Dormer
wants it in notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let him come and fetch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence rose from her chair and shook her dress
into straighter folds, with the air of having accomplished a task which
she had known to be difficult, but not impossible to one equipped with
wit and self-confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will sell the securities, and have it all ready by ten
o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning,&rdquo; she repeated, with a feminine
insistence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have the money to-morrow morning, whether I succeed
in selling for cash or not,&rdquo; was the reply, and John Turner concealed
a yawn with imperfect success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A loan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No banker lends&mdash;except to kings,&rdquo; replied Turner,
stolidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call it an accommodation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence glanced at him sharply over the fur collar
which she was clasping round her neck.&nbsp; Here was a banker, reputed
wealthy, who sat in a bare room, without so much as a fireproof safe
to suggest riches; a business man of world-wide affairs, who drummed
indolent fingers on a bare table; a philosopher with a maxim ever ready
to teach, as all maxims do, cowardice in the guise of prudence, selfishness
masquerading as worldly wisdom, hard-heartedness passing for foresight.&nbsp;
Here was one who seemed to see, and was yet too sleepy to perceive.&nbsp;
Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence was not always sure of her banker, but now,
as ever before, one glance at his round, heavy face reassured her.&nbsp;
She laughed and went away, well satisfied with the knowledge, only given
to women, of having once more carried out her object with the completeness
which is known as twisting round the little finger.</p>
<p>She nodded to Turner, who had ponderously risen from the chair which
was more comfortable than the client&rsquo;s seat, and held the door
open for her to pass.&nbsp; He glanced at the clock as he did so.&nbsp;
And she knew that he was thinking that it was nearly the luncheon hour,
so transparent to the feminine perception are the thoughts of men.</p>
<p>When he had closed the door he returned to his writing-table.&nbsp;
Like many stout people, he moved noiselessly, and quickly enough when
the occasion demanded haste.</p>
<p>He wrote three letters in a very few minutes, and, when they were
addressed, he tapped on the table with the end of his pen-holder, which
brought, in the twinkling of an eye, that clerk whose business it was
to abandon his books when called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not go out to luncheon until I have the written receipt
for each one of those letters,&rdquo; said the banker, knowing that
until he went out to luncheon his six clerks must needs go hungry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not an answer,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but a receipt in the
addressee&rsquo;s writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while the clerk hurried from the room and down the stone stairs
at a break-neck speed, Turner sank back into his chair, with lustreless
eyes fixed on space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can wait,&rdquo; he was in the habit of saying, &ldquo;better
than I can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.&nbsp; THE LANE OF MANY TURNINGS</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>If John Turner expected Colville to bring Loo Barebone with him to
the Rue Lafayette he was, in part, disappointed.&nbsp; Colville arrived
in a hired carriage, of which the blinds were partially lowered.</p>
<p>The driver had been instructed to drive into the roomy court-yard
of the house of which Turner&rsquo;s office occupied the first floor.&nbsp;
Carriages frequently waited there, by the side of a little fountain
which splashed all day and all night into a circular basin.</p>
<p>Colville descended from the carriage and turned to speak to Loo,
who was left sitting within it.&nbsp; Since the unfortunate night at
the Hotel Gemosac, when they had been on the verge of a quarrel, a certain
restraint had characterised their intercourse.&nbsp; Colville was shy
of approaching the subject upon which they had differed.&nbsp; His easy
laugh had not laughed away the grim fact that he had deceived Loo in
such a manner that complicity was practically forced upon an innocent
man.</p>
<p>Loo had not given his decision yet.&nbsp; He had waited a week, during
which time Colville had not dared to ask him whether his mind was made
up.&nbsp; There was a sort of recklessness in Loo&rsquo;s manner which
at once puzzled and alarmed his mentor.&nbsp; At times he was gay, as
he always had been, and in the midst of his gaiety he would turn away
with a gloomy face and go to his own room.</p>
<p>To press the question would be to precipitate a catastrophe.&nbsp;
Dormer Colville decided to go on as if nothing had happened.&nbsp; It
is a compromise with the inconveniences of untruth to which we must
all resort at some crisis or another in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be long,&rdquo; he assured Barebone, with a gay
laugh.&nbsp; The prospect of handling one hundred thousand francs in
notes was perhaps exhilarating; though the actual possession of great
wealth would seem to be of the contrary tendency.&nbsp; There is a profound
melancholy peculiar to the face of the millionaire.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall
not be long; for he is a man of his word, and the money will be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Turner was awaiting his visitor, and gave a large soft hand
inertly into Colville&rsquo;s warm grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always wish I saw more of you,&rdquo; said the new-comer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there not enough of me already?&rdquo; inquired the banker,
pointing to the vacant chair, upon which fell the full light of the
double window.&nbsp; A smaller window opposite to it afforded a view
of the court-yard.&nbsp; And it was at this smaller window that Colville
glanced as he sat down, with a pause indicative of reluctance.</p>
<p>Turner saw the glance and noted the reluctance.&nbsp; He concluded,
perhaps, in the slow, sure mind that worked behind his little peeping
eyes, that Loo Barebone was in the carriage in the court-yard, and that
Colville was anxious to return to him as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very kind of you to say that, I am sure,&rdquo; pursued
Turner, rousing himself to be pleasant and conversational.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,
although the loss is mine, my dear Colville, the fault is mostly yours.&nbsp;
You always know where to find me when you want my society.&nbsp; I am
anchored in this chair, whereas one never knows where one has a butterfly
like yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A butterfly that is getting a bit heavy on the wing,&rdquo;
answered Colville, with his wan and sympathetic smile.&nbsp; He sat
forward in the chair in an attitude antipathetic to digression from
the subject in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see any evidence of that.&nbsp; One hears of you
here and there in France.&nbsp; I suppose, for instance, you know more
than any man in Paris at the present moment of the&mdash;&rdquo; he
paused and suppressed a yawn, &ldquo;the&mdash;er&mdash;vintage.&nbsp;
Anything in it&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I could judge, the rains came too late; but I shall
be glad to tell you all about it another time.&nbsp; This morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I know.&nbsp; You want your money.&nbsp; I have it all
ready for you.&nbsp; But I must make out some sort of receipt, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turner felt vaguely in his pocket, and at last found a letter, from
which he tore the blank sheet, while his companion, glancing from time
to time at the window, watched him impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; said Turner, opening his inkstand, &ldquo;that
the vintage of 1850 will not be drunk by a Republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, my mind was more occupied in
the quality of the vintage than in its ultimate fate.&nbsp; If you make
out a receipt on behalf of Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, I will sign it,&rdquo;
answered Colville, fingering the blotting-paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Received on behalf of, and for, Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence,
the sum of one hundred thousand francs,&rdquo; muttered the banker,
as he wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is only a client, you understand, my dear Colville,&rdquo;
he went on, holding out his hand for the blotting-paper, &ldquo;or I
would not part with the money so easily.&nbsp; It is against my advice
that Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence realises this sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a woman sets her heart on a thing, my dear fellow&mdash;&rdquo;
began Colville, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;reason goes to the wall.&nbsp; Sign there,
will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turner handed him pen and receipt, but Colville was looking toward
the window sunk deep in the wall on the inner side of the room.&nbsp;
This was not a double window, and the sound of carriage wheels rose
above the gentle, continuous plash of the little fountain in the court-yard.</p>
<p>Colville rose from his seat, but to reach the window he had to pass
behind Turner&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; Turner rose at the same moment, and
pushed his chair back against the wall in doing so.&nbsp; This passage
toward the window being completely closed by the bulk of John Turner,
Colville hurried round the writing-table.&nbsp; But Turner was again
in front of him, and, without appearing to notice that his companion
was literally at his heels, he opened a large cupboard sunk in the panelling
of the wall.&nbsp; The door of it folded back over the little window,
completely hiding it.</p>
<p>Turning on his heel, with an agility which was quite startling in
one so stout, he found Colville&rsquo;s colourless face two feet from
his own.&nbsp; In fact, Colville almost stumbled against him.&nbsp;
For a moment they looked each other in the eyes in silence.&nbsp; With
his right hand, John Turner held the cupboard-door over the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the money here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in this cupboard.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And as he spoke, a hollow rumble, echoing in the court-yard, marked
the exit of a carriage under the archway into the Rue Lafayette.&nbsp;
There had been only one carriage in attendance in the court-yard&mdash;that
in which Colville had left Barebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, in this cupboard,&rdquo; repeated Turner to unheeding
ears.&nbsp; For Dormer Colville was already hurrying across the room
toward the other window that looked out into the Rue Lafayette.&nbsp;
The house was a lofty one, with a high entresol, and from the windows
of the first floor it was not possible to see the street immediately
below without opening the sashes.</p>
<p>Turner closed the cupboard and locked it, without ceasing to watch
Colville, who was struggling with the stiff fastening of the outer sash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything the matter?&rdquo; inquired the banker, placidly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lost a dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Colville had at length wrenched open the window and was leaning
out.&nbsp; The roar of the traffic drowned any answer he may have made.&nbsp;
It was manifest that the loss of three precious minutes had made him
too late.&nbsp; After a glance down into the street, he came back into
the centre of the room and snatched up his hat from Turner&rsquo;s bare
writing-table.</p>
<p>He hurried to the door, but turned again, with his back against it,
to face his companion, with the eyes usually so affable and sympathetic,
ablaze for once with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the door banged on his heels as he hurried through the outer
office.</p>
<p>Turner was left standing, a massive incarnation of bewilderment,
in the middle of the room.&nbsp; He heard the outer door close with
considerable emphasis.&nbsp; Then he sat down again, his eyebrows raised
high on his round forehead, and gazed sadly at the date-card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>
<p>Colville had left Loo Barebone seated in the hired carriage in a
frame of mind far from satisfactory.&nbsp; A sea-faring life, more than
any other, teaches a man quickness in action.&nbsp; A hundred times
a day the sailor needs to execute, with a rapidity impossible to the
landsman, that which knowledge tells him to be the imminent necessity
of the moment.&nbsp; At sea, life is so far simpler than in towns that
there are only two ways: the right and the wrong.&nbsp; In the devious
paths of a pavement-ridden man there are a hundred byways: there is
the long, long lane of many turnings called Compromise.</p>
<p>Loo Barebone had turned into this lane one night at the Hotel Gemosac,
in the Ruelle St. Jacob, and had wandered there ever since.&nbsp; Captain
Clubbe had taught him the two ways of seamanship effectively enough.&nbsp;
But the education fell short of the necessities of this crisis.&nbsp;
Moreover, Barebone had in his veins blood of a race which had fallen
to low estate through Compromise and Delay.</p>
<p>Let those throw the first stone at him who have seen the right way
gaping before their feet with a hundred pitfalls and barriers, apparently
insurmountable, and have resolutely taken that road.&nbsp; For the devious
path of Compromise has this merit&mdash;that the obstacles are round
the corner.</p>
<p>Barebone, absorbed in thought, hardly noticed that the driver of
his carriage descended from the box and lounged toward the archway,
where the hum of traffic and the passage of many people would serve
to beguile a long wait.&nbsp; After a minute&rsquo;s delay, a driver
returned and climbed to the seat&mdash;but it was not the same driver.&nbsp;
He wore the same coat and hat, but a different face looked out from
the sheepskin collar turned up to the ears.&nbsp; There was no one in
the court-yard to notice this trifling change.&nbsp; Barebone was not
even looking out of the window.&nbsp; He had never glanced at the cabman&rsquo;s
face, whose vehicle had happened to be lingering at the corner of the
Ruelle St. Jacob when Colville and his companion had emerged from the
high doorway of the Hotel Gemosac.</p>
<p>Barebone was so far obeying instructions that he was leaning back
in the carriage, his face half hidden by the collar of his coat.&nbsp;
For it was a cold morning in mid-winter.&nbsp; He hardly looked up when
the handle of the door was turned.&nbsp; Colville had shut this door
five minutes earlier, promising to return immediately.&nbsp; It was
undoubtedly his hand that opened the door.&nbsp; But suddenly Barebone
sat up.&nbsp; Both doors were open.</p>
<p>Before he could make another movement, two men stepped quietly into
the carriage, each closing the door by which he had entered quickly
and noiselessly.&nbsp; One seated himself beside Barebone, the other
opposite to him, and each drew down a blind.&nbsp; They seemed to have
rehearsed the actions over and over again, so that there was no hitch
or noise or bungling.&nbsp; The whole was executed as if by clock-work,
and the carriage moved away the instant the doors were closed.</p>
<p>In the twilight, within the carriage, the two men grasped Loo Barebone,
each by one arm, and held him firmly against the back of the carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quietly, <i>mon bon monsieur</i>; quietly, and you will come
to no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone made no resistance, and only laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come too soon,&rdquo; he said, without attempting
to free his arms, which were held, as if by a vice, at the elbow and
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have come too soon, gentlemen!&nbsp; There
is no money in the carriage.&nbsp; Not so much as a sou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for money that we have come,&rdquo; replied the
man who had first spoken&mdash;and the absolute silence of his companion
was obviously the silence of a subordinate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though, for
a larger sum than monsieur is likely to offer, one might make a mistake,
and allow of escape&mdash;who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark was made with the cynical honesty of dishonesty which
had so lately been introduced into France by him who was now Dictator
of that facile people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I offer nothing,&rdquo; replied Barebone.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
a good reason.&nbsp; I have nothing to offer.&nbsp; If you are not thieves,
what are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage was rattling along the Rue Lafayette, over the cobble-stones,
and the inmates, though their faces were close together, had to shout
in order to be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the police,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of the high
police.&nbsp; I fancy that monsieur&rsquo;s affair is political?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you fancy that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because my comrade and I are not engaged on other cases.&nbsp;
The criminal receives very different treatment.&nbsp; Permit me to assure
you of that.&nbsp; And no consideration whatever.&nbsp; The common police
is so unmannerly.&nbsp; There!&mdash;one may well release the arms&mdash;since
we understand each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not try to escape&mdash;if that is what you mean,&rdquo;
replied Barebone, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else&mdash;nothing else,&rdquo; his affable captor
assured him.</p>
<p>And for the remainder of a long drive through the noisy streets the
three men sat upright in the dim and musty cab in silence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.&nbsp; SANS RANCUNE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A large French fishing-lugger was drifting northward on the ebb tide
with its sails flapping idly against the spars.&nbsp; It had been a
fine morning, and the Captain, a man from F&eacute;camp, where every
boy that is born is born a sailor, had been fortunate in working his
way in clear weather across the banks that lie northward of the Thames.</p>
<p>He had predicted all along in a voice rendered husky by much shouting
in dirty weather that the fog-banks would be drifting in from the sea
before nightfall.&nbsp; And now he had that mournful satisfaction which
is the special privilege of the pessimistic.&nbsp; These fog-banks,
the pest of the east coast, are the materials that form the light fleecy
clouds which drift westward in sunny weather like a gauze veil across
the face of the sky.&nbsp; They roll across the North Sea from their
home in the marshes of Holland on the face of the waters, and the mariner,
groping his way with dripping eyelashes and a rosy face through them,
can look up and see the blue sky through the rifts overhead.&nbsp; When
the fog-bank touches land it rises, slowly lifted by the warm breath
of the field.</p>
<p>On the coast-line it lies low; a mile inland it begins to break into
rifts, so that any one working his way down one of the tidal rivers,
sails in the counting of twenty seconds from sunshine into a pearly
shadow.&nbsp; Five miles inland there is a transparent veil across the
blue sky slowly sweeping toward the west, and rising all the while,
until those who dwell on the higher lands of Essex and Suffolk perceive
nothing but a few fleecy clouds high in the heavens.</p>
<p>The lugger was hardly moving, for the tide had only turned half an
hour ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided,&rdquo; the Captain had muttered within the folds
of his woollen scarf rolled round and round his neck until it looked
like a dusky life-belt&mdash;&ldquo;provided that they are ringing their
bell on the Shipwash, we shall find our way into the open.&nbsp; Always
sea-sick, this traveller, always seasick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he turned with a kindly laugh to Loo Barebone, who was lying
on a heap of old sails by the stern rail, concealing as well as he could
the pangs of a consuming hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One sees that you will never be a sailor,&rdquo; added the
man from F&eacute;camp, with that rough humour which sailors use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do not want to be one,&rdquo; replied Barebone,
with a ready gaiety which had already made him several friends on this
tarry vessel, although the voyage had lasted but four days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; interrupted the Captain, holding up a mittened
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen!&nbsp; I hear a bell, or else it is my conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone had heard it for some time.&nbsp; It was the bell-buoy at
the mouth of Harwich River.&nbsp; But he did not deem it necessary for
one who was a prisoner on board, and no sailor, to interfere in the
navigation of a vessel now making its way to the Far&ouml;e fisheries
for the twentieth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My conscience,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;rings louder than
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain took a turn round the tiller with a rope made fast to
the rail for the purpose, and went to the side of the ship, lifting
his nose toward the west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the land,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can smell it.&nbsp;
But it is only the Blessed Virgin who knows where we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and gave a gruff order to a man half hidden in the mist
in the waist of the boat to try a heave of the lead.</p>
<p>The sound of the bell could be heard clearly enough now&mdash;the
uncertain, hesitating clang of a bell-buoy rocked in the tideway&mdash;with
its melancholy note of warning.&nbsp; Indeed, there are few sounds on
sea or land more fraught with lonesomeness and fear.&nbsp; Behind it
and beyond it a faint &ldquo;tap-tap&rdquo; was now audible.&nbsp; Barebone
knew it to be the sound of a caulker&rsquo;s hammer in the Government
repairing yard on the south side.&nbsp; They were drifting past the
mouth of the Harwich River.</p>
<p>The leadsman called out a depth which Loo could have told without
the help of line or lead.&nbsp; For he had served a long apprenticeship
on these coasts under a captain second to none in the North Sea.</p>
<p>He turned a little on his bed of sails under repair, at which the
Captain had been plying his needle while the weather remained clear,
and glanced over his shoulder toward the ship&rsquo;s dinghy towing
astern.&nbsp; The rope that held it was made fast round the rail a few
feet away from him.&nbsp; The boat itself was clumsy, shaped like a
walnut, of a preposterous strength and weight.&nbsp; It was fitted with
a short, stiff mast and a balance lug-sail.&nbsp; It floated more lightly
on the water than the bigger vessel, which was laden with coal and provender
and salt for the North Atlantic fishery, and the painter hung loose,
while the dinghy, tide-borne, sidled up to stern of its big companion
like a kitten following its mother with the uncertain steps of infancy.</p>
<p>The face of the water was glassy and of a yellow green.&nbsp; Although
the scud swept in toward the land at a fair speed, there was not enough
wind to fill the sails.&nbsp; Moreover, the bounty of Holland seemed
inexhaustible.&nbsp; There was more to come.&nbsp; This fog-bank lay
on the water halfway across the North Sea, and the brief winter sun
having failed to disperse it, was now sinking to the west, cold and
pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water seems shallow,&rdquo; said Barebone to the Captain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What would you do if the ship went aground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should stay there, <i>mon bon monsieur</i>, until some
one came to help us at the flood tide.&nbsp; We should shout until they
heard us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might fire a gun,&rdquo; suggested Barebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no gun on board, <i>mon bon monsieur</i>,&rdquo; replied
the Captain, who had long ago explained to his prisoner that there was
no ill-feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the fortune of war,&rdquo; he had explained before the
white cliffs of St. Valerie had faded from sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
a poor man who cannot afford to refuse a good offer.&nbsp; It is a Government
job, as you no doubt know without my telling you.&nbsp; You would seem
to have incurred the displeasure or the distrust of some one high placed
in the Government.&nbsp; &lsquo;Treat him well,&rsquo; they said to
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give him your best, and see that he comes to no harm
unless he tries to escape.&nbsp; And be careful that he does not return
to France before the mackerel fishing begins.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when
we do return to F&eacute;camp, I have to lie to off Notre Dame de la
Garde and signal to the Douane that I have you safe.&nbsp; They want
you out of the way.&nbsp; You are a dangerous man, it seems.&nbsp; <i>Salut</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Captain raised his glass to one so distinguished by Government.&nbsp;
He laughed as he set his glass down on the little cabin table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ill-feeling on either side,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est
entendu</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a half-movement as if to shake hands across the table and
thought better of it, remembering, perhaps, that his own palm was not
innocent of blood-money.&nbsp; For the rest they had been friendly enough
on the voyage.&nbsp; And had the &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo; been in
danger, it is probable that Barebone would have warned his jailer, if
only in obedience to a seaman&rsquo;s instinct against throwing away
a good ship.</p>
<p>He had noted every detail, however, of the dinghy while he lay on
the deck of the &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo;; how the runner fitted to
the mast; whether the halliards were likely to run sweetly through the
sheaves or were knotted and would jamb.&nbsp; He knew the weight of
the gaff and the great tan-soddened sail to a nicety.&nbsp; Some dark
night, he had thought, on the Dogger, he would slip overboard and take
his chance.&nbsp; He had never looked for thick weather at this time
of year off the Banks, so near home, within a few hours&rsquo; sail
of the mouth of Farlingford River.</p>
<p>If a breeze would only come up from the south-east, as it almost
always does in these waters toward the evening of a still, fine day!&nbsp;
Without lifting his head he scanned the weather, noting that the scud
was blowing more northward now.&nbsp; It might only be what is known
as a slant.&nbsp; On the other hand, it might prove to be a true breeze,
coming from the usual quarter.&nbsp; The &ldquo;tap-tap&rdquo; of the
caulker&rsquo;s hammer on the slip-way in Harwich River was silent now.&nbsp;
There must be a breeze in-shore that carried the sound away.</p>
<p>The topsail of the &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo; filled with a jerk,
and the Captain, standing at the tiller, looked up at it.&nbsp; The
lower sails soon took their cue, and suddenly the slack sheets hummed
taut in the breeze.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo; answered to
it at once, and the waves gurgled and laughed beneath her counter as
she moved through the water.&nbsp; She could sail quicker than her dinghy:
Barebone knew that.&nbsp; But he also knew that he could handle an open
boat as few even on the C&ocirc;tes-du-Nord knew how.</p>
<p>If the breeze came strong, it would blow the fog-bank away, and Barebone
had need of its covert.&nbsp; Though there must be many English boats
within sight should the fog lift&mdash;indeed, the guardship in Harwich
harbour would be almost visible across the spit of land where Landguard
Fort lies hidden&mdash;Barebone had no intention of asking help so compromising.&nbsp;
He had but a queer story to tell to any in authority, and on the face
of it he must perforce appear to have run away with the dinghy of the
&ldquo;Petite Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He desired to get ashore as unobtrusively as possible.&nbsp; For
he was not going to stay in England.&nbsp; The die was cast now.&nbsp;
Where Dormer Colville&rsquo;s persuasions had failed, where the memory
of that journey through Royalist France had yet left him doubting, the
incidents of the last few days had clinched the matter once for all.&nbsp;
Barebone was going back to France.</p>
<p>He moved as if to stretch his limbs and lay down once more, with
his shoulders against the rail and his elbow covering the stanchion
round which the dinghy&rsquo;s painter was made fast.</p>
<p>The proper place for the dinghy was on deck should the breeze freshen.&nbsp;
Barebone knew that as well as the French Captain of the &ldquo;Petite
Jeanne.&rdquo;&nbsp; For seamanship is like music&mdash;it is independent
of language or race.&nbsp; There is only one right way and one wrong
way at sea, all the world over.&nbsp; The dinghy was only towing behind
while the fog continued to be impenetrable.&nbsp; At any moment the
Captain might give the order to bring it inboard.</p>
<p>At any moment Barebone might have to make a dash for the boat.</p>
<p>He watched the Captain, who continued to steer in silence.&nbsp;
To drift on the tide in a fog is a very different thing to sailing through
it at ten miles an hour on a strong breeze, and the steersman had no
thought to spare for anything but his sails.&nbsp; Two men were keeping
the look-out in the bows.&nbsp; Another&mdash;the leadsman&mdash;was
standing amidships peering over the side into the mist.</p>
<p>Still Barebone waited.&nbsp; Captain Clubbe had taught him that most
difficult art&mdash;to select with patience and a perfect judgment the
right moment.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo; was rustling through
the glassy water northward toward Farlingford.</p>
<p>At a word from the Captain the man who had been heaving the lead
came aft to the ship&rsquo;s bell and struck ten quick strokes.&nbsp;
He waited and repeated the warning, but no one answered.&nbsp; They
were alone in these shallow channels.&nbsp; Fortunately the man faced
forward, as sailors always do by instinct, turning his back upon the
Captain and Barebone.</p>
<p>The painter was cast off now and, under his elbow, Barebone was slowly
hauling in.&nbsp; The dinghy was heavy and the &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo;
was moving quickly through the water.&nbsp; Suddenly Barebone rose to
his feet, hauled in hand over hand, and when the dinghy was near enough,
leaped across two yards of water to her gunwale.</p>
<p>The Captain heard the thud of his feet on the thwart, and looking
back over his shoulder saw and understood in a flash of thought.&nbsp;
But even then he did not understand that Loo was aught else but a landsman
half-recovered from seasickness.&nbsp; He understood it a minute later,
however, when the brown sail ran up the mast and, holding the tiller
between his knees, Barebone hauled in the sheet hand over hand and steered
a course out to sea.</p>
<p>He looked back over the foot of the sail and waved his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sans rancune</i>!&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est
entendu</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Captain&rsquo;s own words.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo; was already round to the wind, and
the Captain was bellowing to his crew to trim the sails.&nbsp; It could
scarcely be a chase, for the huge deep-sea fishing-boat could sail half
as fast again as her own dinghy.&nbsp; The Captain gave his instructions
with all the quickness of his race, and the men were not slow to carry
them out.&nbsp; The safe-keeping of the prisoner had been made of personal
advantage to each member of the crew.</p>
<p>The Captain hailed Barebone with winged words which need not be set
down here, and explained to him the impossibility of escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you&mdash;a landsman,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;hope
to get away from us?&nbsp; Come back and it shall be as you say, <i>&lsquo;sans
rancune</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Name of God! I bear you no ill-will for making
the attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were so close together that all on board the &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo;
could see Barebone laugh and shake his head.&nbsp; He knew that there
was no gun on board the fishing-boat.&nbsp; The lugger rushed on, sailing
quicker, lying up closer to the wind.&nbsp; She was within twenty yards
of the little boat now&mdash;would overhaul her in a minute.</p>
<p>But in an instant Barebone was round on the other tack, and the Captain
swore aloud, for he knew now that he was not dealing with a landsman.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo; spun round almost as quickly, but not
quite.&nbsp; Every time that Barebone put about, the &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo;
must perforce do the same, and every time she lost a little in the man&oelig;uvre.&nbsp;
On a long tack or running before the wind the bigger boat was immeasurably
superior.&nbsp; Barebone had but one chance&mdash;to make short tacks&mdash;and
he knew it.&nbsp; The Captain knew it also, and no landsman would have
possessed the knowledge.&nbsp; He was trying to run the boat down now.</p>
<p>Barebone might succeed in getting far enough away to be lost in the
fog.&nbsp; But in tacking so frequently he was liable to make a mistake.&nbsp;
The bigger boat was not so likely to miss stays.&nbsp; He passed so
close to her that he could read the figures cut on her stern-post indicating
her draught of water.</p>
<p>There was another chance.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo; was
drawing six feet; the dinghy could sail across a shoal covered by eighteen
inches of water.&nbsp; But such a shoal would be clearly visible on
the surface of the water.&nbsp; Besides, there was no shallow like that
nearer than the Goodwins.&nbsp; Barebone pressed out seaward.&nbsp;
He knew every channel and every bank between the Thames and Thorpeness.&nbsp;
He kept on pressing out to sea by short tacks.&nbsp; All the while he
was peeping over the gunwale out of the corner of his eye.&nbsp; He
was near, he must be near, a bank covered by five feet of water at low
tide.&nbsp; A shoal of five feet is rarely visible on the surface.</p>
<p>Suddenly he rose from his seat on the gunwale, and stood with the
tiller in one hand and the sheet in the other, half turning back to
look at &ldquo;Petite Jeanne&rdquo; towering almost over him.&nbsp;
And as he looked, her bluff black bows rose upward with an odd climbing
movement like a horse stepping up a bank.&nbsp; With a rattle of ropes
and blocks she stood still.</p>
<p>Barebone went about again and sailed past her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sans rancune</i>!&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp; But no one heeded
him, for they had other matters to attend to.&nbsp; And the dinghy sailed
into the veil of the mist toward the land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.&nbsp; RETURNED EMPTY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The breeze freshened, and, as was to be expected, blew the fog-bank
away before sunset.</p>
<p>Sep Marvin had been an unwilling student all day.&nbsp; Like many
of his cloth and generation, Parson Marvin pinned all his faith on education.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Give a boy a good education,&rdquo; he said, a hundred times.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Make a gentleman of him, and you have done your duty by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a gentleman of him&mdash;and the world will be glad to
feed and clothe him,&rdquo; was the real thought in his mind, as it
was in the mind of nearly all his contemporaries.&nbsp; The wildest
dreamer of those days never anticipated that, in the passage of one
brief generation, social advancement should be for the shrewdly ignorant
rather than for the scholar: that it would be better for a man that
his mind be stored with knowledge of the world than the wisdom of the
classics: that the successful grocer might find a kinder welcome in
a palace than the scholar: that the manufacturer of kitchen utensils
might feed with kings and speak to them, without aspirates, between
the courses.</p>
<p>Parson Marvin knew none of these things, however; nor suspected that
the advance of civilisation is not always progressive, but that she
may take hands with vulgarity and dance down-hill, as she does to-day.&nbsp;
His one scheme of life for Sep was that he should be sent to the ancient
school where field-sports are cultivated to-day and English gentlemen
turned upon the world more ignorant than any other gentlemen in the
universe.&nbsp; Then, of course, Sep must go to that College with which
his father&rsquo;s life had been so closely allied.&nbsp; And if it
please God to call him to the Church, and the College should remember
that it had given his father a living, and do the same by him&mdash;for
that reason and no other&mdash;then, of course, Sep would be a made
man.</p>
<p>And the making of Sep had been in progress during the winter day
that a fog-bank came in from the North Sea and clung tenaciously to
the low, surfless coast.&nbsp; In the afternoon the sun broke through
at last, wintry and pale.&nbsp; Sep, who, by some instinct&mdash;the
instinct, it is to be supposed, of young animals&mdash;knew that he
was destined to be of a generation that should cultivate ignorance out
of doors, rather than learning by the fireside, threw aside his books
and cried out that he could no longer breathe in his father&rsquo;s
study.</p>
<p>So Paid Marvin went off, alone, to visit a distant parishioner&mdash;one
who was dying by himself out on the marsh, in a cottage cut off from
all the world in a spring tide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that it is high tide at five o&rsquo;clock,
and that there is no moon, and that the dykes will be full.&nbsp; You
will never find your way across the marsh after dark,&rdquo; said Sep&mdash;the
learned in tides and those practical affairs of nature, which were as
a closed book to the scholar.</p>
<p>Parson Marvin vaguely acknowledged the warning and went away, leaving
Sep to accompany Miriam on her daily errand to the simple shops in Farlingford,
which would awake to life and business now that the sea-fog was gone.&nbsp;
For the men of Farlingford, like nearly all seafarers, are timorous
of bad weather on shore and sit indoors during its passage, while they
treat storm and rain with a calm contempt at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sail a-coming up the river, master,&rdquo; River Andrew said
to Sep, who was awaiting Miriam in the village street, and he walked
on, without further comment, spade on shoulder, toward the church-yard,
where he spent a portion of his day, without apparent effect.</p>
<p>So, when Miriam had done her shopping, it was only natural that they
should turn their footsteps toward the quay and the river-wall.&nbsp;
Or was it fate?&nbsp; So often is the natural nothing but the inevitable
in holiday garb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no Farlingford boat,&rdquo; said Sep, versed in riverside
knowledge, so soon as he saw the balance-lug moving along the line of
the river-wall, half a mile below the village.</p>
<p>They stood watching.&nbsp; Few coasters were at sea in these months
of wild weather, and there was nothing moving on the quay.&nbsp; The
moss-grown slip-way, where &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; had been drawn
up for repair, stood gaunt and empty, half submerged by the flowing
tide.&nbsp; Many Farlingford men were engaged in the winter fisheries
on the Dogger, and farther north, in Lowestoft boats.&nbsp; In winter,
Farlingford&mdash;thrust out into the North Sea, surrounded by marsh&mdash;is
forgotten by the world.</p>
<p>The solitary boat came round the corner into the wider sheet of water,
locally known as Quay Reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A foreigner!&rdquo; cried Sep, jumping, as was his wont, from
one foot to the other with excitement.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is like the boat
that was brought up by the tide, with a dead man in it, long ago.&nbsp;
And that was a Belgian boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miriam was looking at the boat with a sudden brightness in her eyes,
a rush of colour to her cheeks, which were round and healthy and of
that soft clear pink which marks a face swept constantly by mist and
a salty air.&nbsp; In flat countries, where men may see each other,
unimpeded by hedge or tree or hillock, across a space measured only
by miles, the eye is soon trained&mdash;like the sailor&rsquo;s eye&mdash;to
see and recognise at a great distance.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the attitude of the solitary steersman of
this foreign boat stealing quietly up to Farlingford on the flood tide.&nbsp;
It was Loo Barebone sitting on the gunwale as he always sat, with one
knee raised on the thwart, to support his elbow, and his chin in the
palm of his hand, so that he could glance up the head of the sail or
ahead, without needing to change his position.</p>
<p>Sep turned and looked up at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said he was never coming back,&rdquo; he said,
reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did.&nbsp; I thought he was never coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sep looked at her again, and then at the boat.&nbsp; One never knows
how much children, and dogs&mdash;who live daily with human beings&mdash;understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your face is very red,&rdquo; he observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
comes from telling untruths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It comes from the cold wind,&rdquo; replied Miriam, with an
odd, breathless laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do not go home, he will be there before us,&rdquo; said
Sep, gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will make one tack across to the other
side, and then make the mouth of the creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned and walked, side by side, on the top of the sea-wall
toward the rectory.&nbsp; Their figures must have been outlined against
the sky, for any watching from the river.&nbsp; The girl, tall and strong,
walking with the ease that comes from health and a steadfast mind; the
eager, restless boy running and jumping by her side.&nbsp; Barebone
must have seen them as soon as they saw him.&nbsp; They were part of
Farlingford, these two.&nbsp; He had a sudden feeling of having been
away for years, with this difference&mdash;that he came back and found
nothing changed.&nbsp; Whereas, in reality, he who returns after a long
absence usually finds no one awaiting him.</p>
<p>He did as Sep had foretold&mdash;crossing to the far side of the
river, and then gaining the mouth of the creek in one tack.&nbsp; Miriam
and Sep had reached the rectory garden first, and now stood waiting
for him.&nbsp; He came on in silence.&nbsp; Last time&mdash;on &ldquo;The
Last Hope&rdquo;&mdash;he had come up the river singing.</p>
<p>Sep waved his hand, and, in response, Barebone nodded his head, with
one eye peering ahead, for the breeze was fresh.</p>
<p>The old chain was still there, imperfectly fastened round a tottering
post at the foot of the tide-washed steps.&nbsp; It clinked as he made
fast the boat.&nbsp; Miriam had not heard the sound of it since that
night, long ago, when Loo had gone down the steps in the dark and cast
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was given a passage home in a French fishing-boat, and borrowed
their dinghy to come ashore in,&rdquo; said Loo, as he came up the steps.&nbsp;
He knew that Farlingford would want some explanation, and that Sep would
be proud to give it.&nbsp; An explanation is never the worse for a spice
of truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miriam told me you were never coming home again,&rdquo; answered
Sep, still nourishing that grievance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she was wrong, and here I am!&rdquo; was Loo&rsquo;s
reply, with his old, ready laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;And here is Farlingford&mdash;unchanged,
and no harm done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should there be any harm done?&rdquo; was Sep&rsquo;s
prompt question.</p>
<p>Barebone was shaking hands with Miriam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because
there always is harm done, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miriam was thinking that he had changed; that the man who had unmoored
his boat at these steps six months ago had departed for ever, and that
another had come back in his place.&nbsp; A minute later, as he turned
to close the gate that shut off the rectory garden from the river-wall,
chance ruled it that their eyes should meet for an instant, and she
knew that he had not changed; that he might, perhaps, never change so
long as he lived.&nbsp; She turned abruptly and led the way to the house.</p>
<p>Sep had a hundred questions to ask, but only a few of them were personal.&nbsp;
Children live in a world of their own, and are not slow to invite those
whom they like to come to it, while to the others, they shut the door
with a greater frankness than is permissible later in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;has gone to see old Doy,
who is dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he still dying?&nbsp; He will never die, I am sure; for
he has been trying to do it ever since I remember,&rdquo; laughed Barebone;
who was interested, it seemed, in Sep&rsquo;s affairs, and never noticed
that Miriam was walking more quickly than they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am rather anxious about him,&rdquo; continued Sep, with
the gravity that comes of a realised responsibility.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
moons along, you know, with his mind far away, and he doesn&rsquo;t
know the path across the marsh a bit.&nbsp; He is bound to lose his
way, and it is getting dark.&nbsp; Suppose I shall have to go and look
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a lantern,&rdquo; suggested Loo, darkly, without looking
toward Miriam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; replied Sep, with delight.&nbsp; &ldquo;With
a lantern, of course.&nbsp; Nobody but a fool would go out on to the
marshes after dark without a lantern.&nbsp; The weed on the water makes
it the same as the grass, and that old woman who was nearly drowned
last winter, you know, she walked straight in, and thought it was dry
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Loo heard no more, for they were at the door; and Miriam, in
the lighted hall, was waiting for them, with all the colour gone from
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sure to be in in a few minutes,&rdquo; she said; for
she had heard the end of their talk.&nbsp; She could scarcely have helped
hearing Loo&rsquo;s weighty suggestion of a lantern, which had had the
effect he must have anticipated.&nbsp; Sep was already hurriedly searching
for matches.&nbsp; It would be difficult to dissuade him from his purpose.&nbsp;
What boy would willingly give up the prospect of an adventure on the
marsh alone, with a bull&rsquo;s-eye?&nbsp; Miriam tried, and tried
in vain.&nbsp; She gained time, however, and was listening for Marvin&rsquo;s
footstep on the gravel all the while.</p>
<p>Sep found the matches&mdash;and it chanced that there was a sufficiency
of oil in his lantern.&nbsp; He lighted up and went away, leaving an
abominable smell of untrimmed wick behind him.</p>
<p>It was tea-time, and, half a century ago, that meal was a matter
of greater importance than it is to-day.&nbsp; A fire burned in the
dining-room, glowing warmly on the mellow walls and gleaming furniture;
but there was no lamp, nor need of one, in a room with large windows
facing the sunset sky.</p>
<p>Miriam led the way into this room, and lifted the shining, old-fashioned
kettle to the hob.&nbsp; She took a chair that stood near, and sat,
with her shoulder turned toward him, looking into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have tea as soon as they come in,&rdquo; she said,
in that voice of camaraderie which speaks of a life-long friendship
between a man and a woman&mdash;if such a friendship be possible.&nbsp;
Is it?&mdash;who knows?&nbsp; &ldquo;They will not be long, I am sure.&nbsp;
You will like tea, after having been so long abroad.&nbsp; It is one
of the charms of coming home, or one of the alleviations.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know which.&nbsp; And now, tell me all that has happened since you went
away&mdash;if you care to.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.&nbsp; OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Miriam&rsquo;s manner toward him was the same as it had always been
so long as he could remember.&nbsp; He had once thought&mdash;indeed,
he had made to her the accusation&mdash;that she was always conscious
of the social gulf existing between them; that she always remembered
that she was by birth and breeding a lady, whereas he was the son of
an obscure Frenchman who was nothing but a clockmaker whose name could
be read (and can to this day be deciphered) on a hundred timepieces
in remote East Anglian farms.</p>
<p>Since his change of fortune he had, as all men who rise to a great
height or sink to the depths will tell, noted a corresponding change
in his friends.&nbsp; Even Captain Clubbe had altered, and the affection
which peeped out at times almost against his puritanical will seemed
to have suffered a chill.&nbsp; The men of Farlingford, and even those
who had sailed in &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; with him, seemed to hold
him at a distance.&nbsp; They nodded to him with a brief, friendly smile,
but were shy of shaking hands.&nbsp; The hand which they would have
held out readily enough, had he needed assistance in misfortune, slunk
hastily into a pocket.&nbsp; For he who climbs will lose more friends
than the ne&rsquo;er-do-well.&nbsp; Some may account this to human nature
for righteousness and others quite the contrary: for jealousy, like
love, lies hidden in unsuspected corners.</p>
<p>Juliette de Gemosac had been quite different to Loo since learning
his story.&nbsp; Miriam alone remained unchanged.&nbsp; He had accused
her of failing to rise superior to arbitrary social distinctions, and
now, standing behind her in the fire-lit dining-room of the rectory,
he retracted that accusation once and for all time in his own heart,
though her justification came from a contrary direction to that from
which it might have been expected.</p>
<p>Miriam alone remained a friend&mdash;and nothing else, he added,
bitterly, in his own heart.&nbsp; And she seemed to assume that their
friendship, begun in face of social distinctions, should never have
to suffer from that burthen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to hear,&rdquo; she repeated, seeing that he
was silent, &ldquo;all that has happened since you went away; all that
you may care to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heritage, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved in her seat but did not look round.&nbsp; She had laid
aside her hat on coming into the house, and as she sat, leaning forward
with her hands clasped together in her lap, gazing thoughtfully at the
fire which glowed blue and white for the salt water that was in the
drift-wood, her hair, loosened by the wind, half concealed her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what it is&mdash;my heritage?&rdquo; lapsing,
as he often did when hurried by some pressing thought, into a colloquialism
half French.</p>
<p>She shook her head, but made no audible reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suspect what it is?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have suspected, perhaps,&rdquo; she admitted, after
a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&nbsp; How long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused again.&nbsp; Quick and clever as he was, she was no less
so.&nbsp; She weighed the question.&nbsp; Perhaps she found no answer
to it, for she turned toward the door that stood open and looked out
into the hall.&nbsp; The light of the lamp there fell for a moment across
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I hear them returning,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;for I should hear them before
you did.&nbsp; I was brought up at sea.&nbsp; Do not answer the question,
however, if you would rather not.&nbsp; You ask what has happened since
I went away.&nbsp; A great many things have happened which are of no
importance.&nbsp; Such things always happen, do they not?&nbsp; But
one night, when we were quarrelling, Dormer Colville mentioned your
name.&nbsp; He was very much alarmed and very angry, so he perhaps spoke
the truth&mdash;by accident.&nbsp; He said that you had always known
that I might be the King of France.&nbsp; Many things happened, as I
tell you, which are of no importance, and which I have already forgotten,
but that I remember and always shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always known,&rdquo; replied Miriam, &ldquo;that Mr.
Dormer Colville is a liar.&nbsp; It is written on his face, for those
who care to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman at bay is rarely merciful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought for an instant,&rdquo; pursued Loo, &ldquo;that
such a knowledge might have been in your mind that night, the last I
was here, last summer, on the river-wall.&nbsp; I had a vague idea that
it might have influenced in some way the reply you gave me then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had come a step nearer and was standing over her.&nbsp; She could
hear his hurried breathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she replied, in a calm voice full of friendliness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are quite wrong.&nbsp; The reason I gave you still holds
good, and&mdash;and always will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the brief silence that followed this clear statement of affairs,
they both heard the rattle of the iron gate by the seawall.&nbsp; Sep
and his father were coming.&nbsp; Loo turned to look toward the hall
and the front door, dimly visible in the shadow of the porch.&nbsp;
While he did so Miriam passed her hand quickly across her face.&nbsp;
When Loo turned again and glanced down at her, her attitude was unchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you look at me and say that again?&rdquo; he asked, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; And she rose from her
chair.&nbsp; She turned and faced him with the light of the hall-lamp
upon her.&nbsp; She was smiling and self-confident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he said, looking at her closely, &ldquo;as
I stood behind you, that there were tears in your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went past him into the hall to meet Sep and his father, who were
already on the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been the firelight,&rdquo; she said to Barebone
as she passed him.</p>
<p>A minute later Septimus Marvin was shaking him by the hand with a
vague and uncertain but kindly grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sep came running to tell me that you were home again,&rdquo;
he said, struggling out of his overcoat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes.&nbsp;
Home again to the old place.&nbsp; And little changed, I can see.&nbsp;
Little changed, my boy.&nbsp; <i>Tempora mutantur</i>, eh? and we <i>mutamur
in illis</i>.&nbsp; But you are the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; Why should I change?&nbsp; It is too late
to change for the better now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&nbsp; Never say that.&nbsp; But we do not want you
to change.&nbsp; We looked for you to come in a coach-and-four&mdash;did
we not, Miriam?&nbsp; For I suppose you have secured your heritage,
since you are here again.&nbsp; It is a great thing to possess riches&mdash;and
a great responsibility.&nbsp; Come, let us have tea and not think of
such things.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;yes.&nbsp; Let us forget that such a thing
as a heritage ever came between us&mdash;eh, Miriam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a gesture of old-world politeness he stood aside for his
niece to pass first into the dining-room, whither a servant had preceded
them with a lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be hard to do that,&rdquo; replied Miriam, steadily,
&ldquo;because he tells me that he has not yet secured it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time&mdash;all in good time,&rdquo; said Marvin,
with that faith in some occult power, seemingly the Government and Providence
working in conjunction, to which parsons and many women confide their
worldly affairs and sit with folded hands.</p>
<p>He asked many questions which were easy enough to answer; for he
had no worldly wisdom himself, and did not look for it in other people.&nbsp;
And then he related his own adventure&mdash;the great incident of his
life&mdash;his visit to Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A matter of business,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some
duplicates&mdash;one or two of my prints which I had decided to part
with.&nbsp; Miriam also wished me to see into some small money matters
of her own.&nbsp; Her guardian, John Turner, you may remember, resides
in Paris.&nbsp; A schoolfellow of my own, by the way.&nbsp; But our
ways diverged later in life.&nbsp; I found him unchanged&mdash;a kind
heart&mdash;always a kind heart.&nbsp; He attempts to conceal it, as
many do, under a flippant, almost a profane, manner of speech.&nbsp;
<i>Brutum fulmen</i>.&nbsp; But I saw through it&mdash;I saw through
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the rector beamed on Loo through his spectacles with an innocent
delight in a Christian charity which he mistook for cunning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we have spent a little
money on the rectory.&nbsp; To-morrow you will see that we have made
good the roof of the church.&nbsp; One could not ask the villagers to
contribute, knowing that the children want boots and scarcely know the
taste of jam.&nbsp; Yes, John Turner was very kind to me.&nbsp; He found
me a buyer for one of my prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rector broke off with a sharp sigh and drank his tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall never miss it,&rdquo; he added, with the hopefulness
of those who can blind themselves to facts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, tell
me your impressions of France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been there before,&rdquo; replied Loo, with a curtness
so unusual as to make Miriam glance at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been
there before, you know.&nbsp; It would be more interesting to hear your
own impressions, which must be fresher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miriam knew that he did not want to speak of France, and wondered
why.&nbsp; But Marvin, eager to talk of his favourite study, seized
the suggestion in all innocence.&nbsp; He had gone to Paris as he had
wandered through life, with the mind of a child, eager, receptive, open
to impression.&nbsp; Such minds pass by much that is of value, but to
one or two conclusions they bring a perceptive comprehension which is
photographic in its accuracy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have followed her history with unflagging interest since
boyhood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but never until now have I understood
France.&nbsp; I walked through the streets of Paris and I looked into
the faces of the people, and I realised that the astonishing history
of France is true.&nbsp; One can see it in those faces.&nbsp; The city
is brilliant, beautiful, unreal.&nbsp; The reality is in the faces of
the people.&nbsp; Do you remember what Wellington said of them half
a century ago?&nbsp; &lsquo;They are ripe,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for
another Napoleon.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he could not see that Napoleon on
the political horizon.&nbsp; And that is what I saw in their faces.&nbsp;
They are ripe for something&mdash;they know not what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did John Turner tell you that?&rdquo; asked Loo, in an eager
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;He who has lived in Paris all his life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Miriam caught the thrill of excitement in the voice that put
this question.&nbsp; She glanced at Loo.&nbsp; His eyes were bright
and his cheeks colourless.&nbsp; She knew that she was in the presence
of some feeling that she did not understand.&nbsp; It was odd that an
old scholar, knowing nothing but history, could thus stir a listener
whose touch had hitherto only skimmed the surface of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Marvin, with assurance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
saw it myself in their faces.&nbsp; Ah! if another such as Napoleon
could only arise&mdash;such as he, but different.&nbsp; Not an adventurer,
but a King and the descendant of Kings&mdash;not allied, as Napoleon
was, with a hundred other adventurers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Loo, in a muffled voice, looking away toward
the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A King whose wife should be a Queen,&rdquo; pursued the dreamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Loo again, encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could save France,&rdquo; concluded Marvin, taking off
his spectacles and polishing them with a silk handkerchief.&nbsp; Loo
turned and looked at him, for the action so characteristic of a mere
onlooker indicated that the momentary concentration of a mind so stored
with knowledge that confusion reigned there was passing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what?&rdquo; asked Loo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Save France from
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From inevitable disaster, my boy,&rdquo; replied Marvin, gravely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is what I saw in those gay streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loo glanced at him sharply.&nbsp; He had himself seen the same all
through those provinces which must take their cue from Paris whether
they will or no.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a career!&rdquo; murmured Marvin.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
mission for a man to have in life&mdash;to save France!&nbsp; One does
not like to think of the world without a France to lead it in nearly
everything, or with a France, a mere ghost of her former self, exploited,
depleted by another Bonaparte.&nbsp; And we must look in vain for that
man as did the good Duke years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to have a shot at it,&rdquo; put in Sep, who
had just despatched a large piece of cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; exclaimed his father, only half in jest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better sit all day under the lee of a boat and make nets,
like Sea Andrew,&rdquo; advised Loo, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Miriam, without looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I&rsquo;d like to have a shot at it,&rdquo;
persisted Sep.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pass the cake, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loo had risen and was looking at the clock.&nbsp; His face was drawn
and tired and his eyes grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come in and see us as often as you can while you
are here?&rdquo; said the kindly rector, as if vaguely conscious of
a change in this visitor.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will always find a welcome
whether you come in a coach-and-four or on foot&mdash;you know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;yes.&nbsp; I know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rector peered at him through his spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will soon be successful
in getting your own.&nbsp; You are worried about it, I fear.&nbsp; The
responsibilities of wealth, perhaps.&nbsp; And yet many rich people
are able to do good in the world, and must therefore be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not suppose I shall ever be rich,&rdquo; said Loo, with
a careless laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, perhaps not.&nbsp; But let us hope that all will be for
the best.&nbsp; You must not attach too much importance to what I said
about France, you know.&nbsp; I may be wrong.&nbsp; Let us hope I am.&nbsp;
For I understand that your heritage is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Loo, who was shaking hands with Sep and
Miriam, &ldquo;my heritage is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will go back to France?&rdquo; inquired Marvin, holding
out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, with a side glance in the direction
of Miriam.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall go back to France.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.&nbsp; BAREBONE&rsquo;S PRICE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>At Farlingford, forgotten of the world, events move slowly and men&rsquo;s
minds assimilate change without shock.&nbsp; Old people look for death
long before it arrives, so that when at last the great change comes
it is effected quite calmly.&nbsp; There is no indecent haste, no scrambling
to put a semblance of finish to the incomplete, as there is in the hurried
death of cities.&nbsp; Young faces grow softly mellow without those
lines and anxious crow&rsquo;s-feet that mar the features of the middle-aged,
who, to earn their daily bread or to kill the tedium of their lives,
find it necessary to dwell in streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loo&rsquo;s home again,&rdquo; men told each other at &ldquo;The
Black Sailor&rdquo;; and the women, who discussed the matter in the
village street, had little to add to this bare piece of news.&nbsp;
There was nothing unusual about it.&nbsp; Indeed, it was customary for
Farlingford men to come home again.&nbsp; They always returned, at last,
from wide wanderings, which a limited conversational capacity seemed
to deprive of all interest.&nbsp; Those that stayed at home learnt a
few names, and that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are ye now from, Willum?&rdquo; the newly returned sailor
would be kindly asked, with the sideward jerk of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m now from Valparaiso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was all that there was to be said about Valparaiso and the
experiences of this circumnavigator.&nbsp; Perhaps it was not considered
good form to inquire further into that which was, after all, his own
business.&nbsp; If you ask an East Anglian questions he will tell you
nothing; if you do not inquire he will tell you less.</p>
<p>No one, therefore, asked Barebone any questions.&nbsp; More especially
is it considered, in seafaring communities, impolite to make inquiry
into your neighbour&rsquo;s misfortune.&nbsp; If a man have the ill
luck to lose his ship, he may well go through the rest of his life without
hearing the mention of her name.&nbsp; It was understood in Farlingford
that Loo Barebone had resigned his post on &ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo;
in order to claim a heritage in France.&nbsp; He had returned home,
and was living quietly at Maidens Grave Farm with Mrs. Clubbe.&nbsp;
It was, therefore, to be presumed that he had failed in his quest.&nbsp;
This was hardly a matter for surprise to such as had inherited from
their forefathers a profound distrust in Frenchmen.</p>
<p>The brief February days followed each other with that monotony, marked
by small events, that quickly lays the years aside.&nbsp; Loo lingered
on, with a vague indecision in his mind which increased as the weeks
passed by and the spell of the wide marsh-lands closed round his soul.&nbsp;
He took up again those studies which the necessity of earning a living
had interrupted years before, and Septimus Marvin, who had never left
off seeking, opened new historical gardens to him and bade him come
in and dig.</p>
<p>Nearly every morning Loo went to the rectory to look up an obscure
reference or elucidate an uncertain period.&nbsp; Nearly every evening,
after the rectory dinner, he returned the books he had borrowed, and
lingered until past Sep&rsquo;s bedtime to discuss the day&rsquo;s reading.&nbsp;
Septimus Marvin, with an enthusiasm which is the reward of the simple-hearted,
led the way down the paths of history while Loo and Miriam followed&mdash;the
man with the quick perception of his race, the woman with that instinctive
and untiring search for the human motive which can put heart into a
printed page of history.</p>
<p>Many a whole lifetime has slipped away in such occupations; for history,
already inexhaustible, grows in bulk day by day.&nbsp; Marvin was happier
than he had ever been, for a great absorption is one of Heaven&rsquo;s
kindest gifts.</p>
<p>For Barebone, France and his quest there, the Marquis de Gemosac,
Dormer Colville, Juliette, lapsed into a sort of dream, while Farlingford
remained a quiet reality.&nbsp; Loo had not written to Dormer Colville.&nbsp;
Captain Clubbe was trading between Alexandria and Bristol.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Last Hope&rdquo; was not to be expected in England before April.&nbsp;
To communicate with Colville would be to turn that past dream, not wholly
pleasant, into a grim reality.&nbsp; Loo therefore put off from day
to day the evil moment.&nbsp; By nature and by training he was a man
of action.&nbsp; He tried to persuade himself that he was made for a
scholar and would be happy to pass the rest of his days in the study
of that history which had occupied Septimus Marvin&rsquo;s thoughts
during a whole lifetime.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was right.&nbsp; He might have been happy enough to pass
his days thus if life were unchanging; if Septimus Marvin should never
age and never die; if Miriam should be always there, with her light
touch on the deeper thoughts, her half-French way of understanding the
unspoken, with her steady friendship which might change, some day, into
something else.&nbsp; This was, of course, inconsistent.&nbsp; Love
itself is the most inconsistent of all human dreams; for it would have
some things change and others remain ever as they are.&nbsp; Whereas
nothing stays unchanged for a single day: love, least of all.&nbsp;
For it must go forward or back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; cried Septimus Marvin, one evening, laying his
hand on the open book before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;See how strong are racial
things.&nbsp; Here are the Bourbons for ever shutting their eyes to
the obvious, for ever putting off the evil moment, for ever temporising&mdash;from
father to son, father to son; generation after generation.&nbsp; Finally
we come to Louis XVI.&nbsp; Read his letters to the Comte d&rsquo;Artois.&nbsp;
They are the letters of a man who knows the truth in his own heart and
will not admit it even to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Loo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you are right.&nbsp;
It is racial, one must suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he glanced at Miriam, who did not meet his eyes but looked at
the open page, with a smile on her lips half sad, wholly tolerant.</p>
<p>Next morning, Loo thought, he would write to Dormer Colville.&nbsp;
But the following evening came, and he had not done so.&nbsp; He went,
as usual, to the rectory, where the same kind welcome awaited him.&nbsp;
Miriam knew that he had not written.&nbsp; Like him, she knew that an
end of some sort must soon come.&nbsp; And the end came an hour later.</p>
<p>Some day, Barebone knew, Dormer Colville would arrive.&nbsp; Every
morning he half looked for him on the seawall, between &ldquo;The Black
Sailor&rdquo; and the rectory garden.&nbsp; Any evening, he was well
aware, the smiling face might greet him in the lamp-lit drawing-room.</p>
<p>Sep had gone to bed earlier that night.&nbsp; The rector was reading
aloud an endless collection of letters, from which the careful student
could scarcely fail to gather side-lights on history.&nbsp; Both Miriam
and Loo heard the clang of the iron gate on the sea-wall.</p>
<p>A minute or two later the old dog, who lived mysteriously in the
back premises, barked, and presently the servant announced that a gentleman
was desirous of speaking to the rector.&nbsp; There were not many gentlemen
within a day&rsquo;s walk of the rectory.&nbsp; Some one must have put
up at &ldquo;The Black Sailor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Theoretically, the rector
was at the call of any of his parishioners at all moments; but in practice
the people of Farlingford never sought his help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman,&rdquo; said Marvin, vaguely; &ldquo;well, let
him come in, Sarah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miriam and Barebone sat silently looking at the door.&nbsp; But the
man who appeared there was not Dormer Colville.&nbsp; It was John Turner.</p>
<p>He evinced no surprise on seeing Barebone, but shook hands with him
with a little nod of the head, which somehow indicated that they had
business together.</p>
<p>He accepted the chair brought forward by Marvin and warmed his hands
at the fire, in no hurry, it would appear, to state the reason for this
unceremonious call.&nbsp; After all, Marvin was his oldest friend and
Miriam his ward.&nbsp; Between old friends, explanations are often better
omitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is many years,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;since
I heard their talk.&nbsp; They speak with their tongues and their teeth,
but not their lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And their throats,&rdquo; put in Marvin, eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
is because they are of Teuton descent.&nbsp; So different from the French,
eh, Turner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turner nodded a placid acquiescence.&nbsp; Then he turned, as far,
it would appear, as the thickness of his neck allowed, toward Barebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw in a French paper,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the &lsquo;Petite
Jeanne&rsquo; had put in to Lowestoft, to replace a dinghy lost at sea.&nbsp;
So I put two and two together.&nbsp; It is my business putting two and
two together, and making five of them when I can, but they generally
make four.&nbsp; I thought I should find you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loo made no answer.&nbsp; He had only seen John Turner once in his
life&mdash;for a short hour, in a room full of people, at Royan.&nbsp;
The banker stared straight in front of him for a few moments.&nbsp;
Then he raised his sleepy little eyes directly to Miriam&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
He heaved a sigh, and fell to studying the burning logs again.&nbsp;
And the colour slowly rose to Miriam&rsquo;s cheeks.&nbsp; The banker,
it seemed, was about his business again, in one of those simple addition
sums, which he sometimes solved correctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, with
a glance in Loo&rsquo;s direction, &ldquo;to you, it must appear that
I am interfering in what is not my own business.&nbsp; You are wrong
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had clasped his hands across his abnormal waistcoat, and he half
closed his eyes as he blinked at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a sort of intermediary angel,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;between
private persons in France and their friends in England.&nbsp; Nothing
to do with state affairs, you understand; at least, very little.&nbsp;
Many persons in England have relations or property in France.&nbsp;
French persons fall in love with people on this side of the Channel,
and vice versa.&nbsp; And, sooner or later, all these persons, who are
in trouble with their property or their affections, come to me, because
money is invariably at the bottom of the trouble.&nbsp; Money is invariably
at the bottom of all trouble.&nbsp; And I represent money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pursed up his lips and gazed somnolently at the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ask
anybody,&rdquo; he went on, dreamily, after a pause, &ldquo;if that
is not the bare truth.&nbsp; Ask Colville, ask Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence,
ask Miriam Liston, sitting here beside us, if I exaggerate the importance
of&mdash;of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one,&rdquo; admitted Barebone, cheerfully, &ldquo;knows
that you occupy a great position in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turner glanced at him and gave a thick chuckle in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very decent of you.&nbsp;
And that point being established, I will explain further, that I am
not here of my own free will.&nbsp; I am only an agent.&nbsp; No man
in his senses would come to Farlingford in mid-winter unless&mdash;&rdquo;
he broke off, with a sharp sigh, and glanced down at Miriam&rsquo;s
slipper resting on the fender, &ldquo;unless he was much younger than
I am.&nbsp; I came because I was paid to do it.&nbsp; Came to make you
a proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make me a proposition?&rdquo; inquired Loo, as the identity
of Turner&rsquo;s hearers had become involved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; And I should recommend you to give it your gravest
consideration.&nbsp; It is one of the most foolish propositions, from
the proposer&rsquo;s point of view, that I have ever had to make: I
should blush to make it, if it were any use blushing, but no one sees
blushes on my cheeks now.&nbsp; Do not decide in a hurry&mdash;sleep
on it.&nbsp; I always sleep on a question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, and seemed about to compose himself to slumber
then and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no longer young,&rdquo; he admitted, after a pause, &ldquo;and
therefore propose to take one of the few alleviations allowed to advancing
years and an increasing avoirdupois.&nbsp; I am going to give you some
advice.&nbsp; There is only one thing worth having in this life, and
that is happiness.&nbsp; Even the possibility of it is worth all other
possibilities put together.&nbsp; If a man have a chance of grasping
happiness&mdash;I mean a home and the wife he wants . . . . and all
that&mdash;he is wise to throw all other chances to the wind.&nbsp;
Such, for instance, as the chance of greatness, of fame or wealth, of
gratified vanity or satisfied ambition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had spoken slowly, and at last he ceased speaking, as if overcome
by a growing drowsiness.&nbsp; A queer silence followed this singular
man&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; Barebone had not resumed his seat.&nbsp; He
was standing by the mantelpiece, as he often did, being quick and eager
when interested, and not content to sit still and express himself calmly
in words, but must needs emphasise his meaning by gestures and a hundred
quick movements of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us have the proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no more advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loo glanced at Miriam.&nbsp; He could see all three faces where he
stood, but only by the light of the fire.&nbsp; Miriam was nearest to
the hearth.&nbsp; He could see that her eyes were aglow&mdash;possibly
with anger.</p>
<p>Barebone shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not an agent&mdash;you are an advocate,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Turner raised his eyes with the patience of a slumbering animal that
has been prodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;your advocate.&nbsp; There
is one more chance I should advise any man to shun&mdash;to cast to
the four winds, and hold on only to that tangible possibility of happiness
in the present&mdash;it is the chance of enjoying, in some dim and distant
future, the satisfaction of having, in a half-forgotten past, done one&rsquo;s
duty.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s first duty is to secure, by all legitimate means,
one&rsquo;s own happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the proposition?&rdquo; interrupted Barebone, quickly;
and Turner, beneath his heavy lids, had caught in the passing the glance
from Miriam&rsquo;s eyes, for which possibly both he and Loo Barebone
had been waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty thousand pounds,&rdquo; replied the banker, bluntly,
&ldquo;in first-class English securities, in return for a written undertaking
on your part to relinquish all claim to any heritage to which you may
think yourself entitled in France.&nbsp; You will need to give your
word of honour never to set foot on French soil&mdash;and that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never, until this moment,&rdquo; replied Barebone, &ldquo;knew
the value of my own pretensions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Turner, quietly; &ldquo;that is the obvious
retort.&nbsp; And having made it, you can now give a few minutes&rsquo;
calm reflection to my proposition&mdash;say five minutes, until that
clock strikes half-past nine&mdash;and then I am ready to answer any
questions you may wish to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone laughed good-humouredly, and so far fell in with the suggestion
that he leant his elbow on the corner of the mantelpiece, and looked
at the clock.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.&nbsp; IN THE DARK</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Had John Turner been able to see round the curve of his own vast
cheeks he might have perceived the answer to his proposition lurking
in a little contemptuous smile at the corner of Miriam&rsquo;s closed
lips.&nbsp; Loo saw it there, and turned again to the contemplation
of the clock on the mantelpiece which had already given a preliminary
click.</p>
<p>Thus they waited until the minutes should elapse, and Turner, with
a smile of simple pleasure at their ready acquiescence in his suggestion,
probably reflected behind his vacuous face that silence rarely implies
indecision.</p>
<p>When at last the clock struck, Loo turned to him with a laugh and
a shake of the head as if the refusal were so self-evident that to put
it into words were a work of supererogation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who makes the offer?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Turner smiled on him with visible approbation as upon a quick and
worthy foe who fought a capable fight with weapons above the board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter&mdash;since you are disposed to refuse.&nbsp; The
money is in my hands, as is the offer.&nbsp; Both are good.&nbsp; Both
will hold good till to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Septimus Marvin gave a little exclamation of approval.&nbsp; He had
been sitting by the table looking from one to the other over his spectacles
with the eager smile of the listener who understands very little, and
while wishing that he understood more, is eager to put in a word of
approval or disapprobation on safe and general lines.&nbsp; It was quite
obvious to John Turner, who had entered the room in ignorance on this
point, that Marvin knew nothing of Barebone&rsquo;s heritage in France
while Miriam knew all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one point,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which is perhaps
scarcely worth mentioning.&nbsp; The man who makes the offer is not
only the most unscrupulous, but is likely to become one of the most
powerful men in Eur&mdash;men I know.&nbsp; There is a reverse side
to the medal.&nbsp; There always is a reverse side to the good things
of this world.&nbsp; Should you refuse his ridiculously generous offer
you will make an enemy for life&mdash;one who is nearing that point
where men stop at nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turner glanced at Miriam again.&nbsp; Her clean-cut features had
a stony stillness and her eyes looked obstinately at the clock.&nbsp;
The banker moved in his chair as if suddenly conscious that it was time
to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not,&rdquo; he said to Barebone, &ldquo;be misled or mislead
yourself into a false estimate of the strength of your own case.&nbsp;
The offer I make you does not in any way indicate that you are in a
strong position.&nbsp; It merely shows the indolence of a man naturally
open-handed, who would always rather pay than fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially if the money is not his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Turner, stolidly, &ldquo;that is so.&nbsp;
Especially if the money is not his own.&nbsp; I dare say you know the
weakness of your own case: others know it too.&nbsp; A portrait is not
much to go on.&nbsp; Portraits are so easily copied; so easily changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose as he spoke and shook hands with Marvin.&nbsp; Then he turned
to Miriam, but he did not meet her glance.&nbsp; Last of all he shook
hands with Barebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep on it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing like sleeping
on a question.&nbsp; I am staying at &lsquo;The Black Sailor.&rsquo;&nbsp;
See you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had come, had transacted his business and gone, all in less than
an hour, with an extraordinary leisureliness almost amounting to indolence.&nbsp;
He had lounged into the house, and now he departed without haste or
explanation.&nbsp; Never hurry, never explain, was the text upon which
John Turner seemed to base the sleepy discourse of his life.&nbsp; For
each of us is a living sermon to his fellows, and, it is to be feared,
the majority are warnings.</p>
<p>Turner had dragged on his thick overcoat, not without Loo&rsquo;s
assistance, and, with the collar turned up about his ears, he went out
into the night, leaving the three persons whom he had found in the drawing-room
standing in the hall looking at the door which he closed decisively
behind him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seize your happiness while you can,&rdquo;
he had urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;If not&mdash;&rdquo; and the decisive closing
of a door on his departing heel said the rest.</p>
<p>The clocks struck ten.&nbsp; It was not worth while going back to
the drawing-room.&nbsp; All Farlingford was abed in those days by nine
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Barebone took his coat and prepared to follow Turner.&nbsp;
Miriam was already lighting her bedroom candle.&nbsp; She bade the two
men good night and went slowly upstairs.&nbsp; As she reached her own
room she heard the front door closed behind Loo and the rattle of the
chain under the uncertain fingers of Septimus Marvin.&nbsp; The sound
of it was like the clink of that other chain by which Barebone had made
fast his boat to the tottering post on the river-wall.</p>
<p>Miriam&rsquo;s room was at the front of the house, and its square
Georgian windows faced eastward across the river to the narrow spit
of marsh-land and the open sea beyond it.&nbsp; A crescent of moon far
gone on the wane, yellow and forlorn, was rising from the sea.&nbsp;
An uncertain path of light lay across the face of the far-off tide-way&mdash;broken
by a narrow strip of darkness and renewed again close at hand across
the wide river almost to the sea-wall beneath the window.&nbsp; From
this window no house could be seen by day&mdash;nothing but a vast expanse
of water and land hardly less level and unbroken.&nbsp; No light was
visible on sea or land now, nothing but the waning moon in a cold clear
sky.</p>
<p>Miriam threw herself, all dressed, on her bed with the abandonment
of one who is worn out by some great effort, and buried her face in
the pillow.</p>
<p>Barebone&rsquo;s way lay to the left along the river-wall by the
side of the creek.&nbsp; Turner had gone to the right, taking the path
that led down the river to the old quay and the village.&nbsp; Whereas
Barebone must turn his back on Farlingford to reach the farm which still
crouches behind a shelter of twisted oaks and still bears the name of
Maiden&rsquo;s Grave; though the name is now nothing but a word.&nbsp;
For no one knows who the maiden was, or where her grave, or what brought
her to it.</p>
<p>The crescent moon gave little light, but Loo knew his way beneath
the stunted cedars and through the barricade of ilex drawn round the
rectory on the northern side.&nbsp; His eyes, trained to darkness, saw
the shadowy form of a man awaiting him beneath the cedars almost as
soon as the door was closed.</p>
<p>He went toward him, perceiving with a sudden misgiving that it was
not John Turner.&nbsp; A momentary silhouette against the northern sky
showed that it was Colville, come at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick&mdash;this way!&rdquo; he whispered, and taking Barebone&rsquo;s
arm he led him through the bushes.&nbsp; He halted in a little open
space between the ilex and the river-wall, which is fifteen feet high
at the meeting of the creek and the larger stream.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
are three men, who are not Farlingford men, on the outer side of the
sea-wall below the rectory landing.&nbsp; Turner must have placed them
there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be even with him yet.&nbsp; There is a large
fishing-smack lying at anchor inside the Ness&mdash;just across the
marsh.&nbsp; It is the &lsquo;Petite Jeanne.&rsquo;&nbsp; I found this
out while you were in there.&nbsp; I could hear your voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you hear what he said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Colville, with a sudden return to his
old manner, easy and sympathetic.&nbsp; &ldquo;No&mdash;this is no time
for joking, I can tell you that.&nbsp; You have had a narrow escape,
I assure you, Barebone.&nbsp; That man, the Captain of the &lsquo;Petite
Jeanne,&rsquo; is well known.&nbsp; There are plenty of people in France
who want to get quietly rid of some family encumbrance&mdash;a man in
the way, you understand, a son too many, a husband too much, a stepson
who will inherit&mdash;the world is full of superfluities.&nbsp; Well,
the Captain of the &lsquo;Petite Jeanne&rsquo; will take them a voyage
for their health to the Iceland fisheries.&nbsp; They are so far and
so remote&mdash;the Iceland fisheries.&nbsp; The climate is bad and
accidents happen.&nbsp; And if the &lsquo;Petite Jeanne&rsquo; returns
short-handed, as she often does, the other boats do the same.&nbsp;
It is only a question of a few entries in the custom-house books at
F&eacute;camp.&nbsp; Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Barebone, thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it suggested itself to you when you were on board,
and that is why you took the first chance of escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly; but I escaped, so it does not matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; acquiesced Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t
matter.&nbsp; But how are we to get out of this?&nbsp; They are waiting
for us under the sea-wall.&nbsp; Is there a way across the marsh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know a way.&nbsp; But where do you want to go
to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of this,&rdquo; whispered Colville, eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out
of Farlingford and Suffolk before the morning if we can.&nbsp; I tell
you there is a French gunboat at Harwich, and another in the North Sea.&nbsp;
It may be chance and it may not.&nbsp; But I suspect there is a warrant
out against you.&nbsp; And, failing that, there is the &lsquo;Petite
Jeanne&rsquo; hanging about waiting to kidnap you a second time.&nbsp;
And Turner&rsquo;s at the bottom of it, damn him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Dormer Colville allowed a glimpse to appear of another man
quite different from the easy, indolent man-of-the-world, the well-dressed
adventurer of a day when adventure was mostly sought in drawing-rooms,
when scented and curled dandies were made or marred by women.&nbsp;
For a moment Colville was roused to anger and seemed capable of manly
action.&nbsp; But in an instant the humour passed and he shrugged his
shoulders and gave a short, indifferent laugh beneath his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;lead the way and I will follow.&nbsp;
I have been out here since eight o&rsquo;clock and it is deucedly cold.&nbsp;
I followed Turner from Paris, for I knew he was on your scent.&nbsp;
Once across the marsh we can talk without fear as we go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone obeyed mechanically, leading the way through the bushes
to the kitchen-garden and over an iron fencing on to the open marsh.&nbsp;
This stretched inland for two miles without a hedge or other fence but
the sunken dykes which intersected it across and across.&nbsp; Any knowing
his way could save two miles on the longer way by the only road connecting
Farlingford with the mainland and tapping the great road that runs north
and south a few miles inland.</p>
<p>There was no path, for few ever passed this way.&nbsp; By day, a
solitary shepherd watched his flocks here.&nbsp; By night the marsh
was deserted.&nbsp; Across some of the dykes a plank is thrown, the
whereabouts of which is indicated by a post, waist-high, driven into
the ground, easily enough seen by day, but hard to find after dark.&nbsp;
Not all the dykes have a plank, and for the most part the marsh is divided
into squares, each only connected at one point with its neighbour.</p>
<p>Barebone knew the way as well as any in Farlingford, and he struck
out across the thick grass which crunched briskly under the foot, for
it was coated with rime, and the icy wind blew in from the sea a freezing
mist.&nbsp; Once or twice Barebone, having made a bee-line across from
dyke to dyke, failed to strike the exact spot where the low post indicated
a plank, and had to pause and stoop down so as to find its silhouette
against the sky.&nbsp; When they reached a plank he tried its strength
with one foot and then led the way across it, turning and waiting at
the far end for Colville to follow.&nbsp; It was unnecessary to warn
him against a slip, for the plank was no more than nine inches wide
and shone white with rime.&nbsp; Each foot must be secure before its
fellow was lifted.</p>
<p>Colville, always ready to fall in with a companion&rsquo;s humour,
ever quick to understand the thoughts of others, respected his silence.&nbsp;
Perhaps he was not far from guessing the cause of it.</p>
<p>Loo was surprised to find that Dormer Colville was less antipathetic
than he had anticipated.&nbsp; For the last month, night and day, he
had dreaded Colville&rsquo;s arrival, and now that he was here he was
almost glad to see him; almost glad to quit Farlingford.&nbsp; And his
heart was hot with anger against Miriam.</p>
<p>Turner&rsquo;s offer had at all events been worth considering.&nbsp;
Had he been alone when it was made he would certainly have considered
it; he would have turned it this way and that.&nbsp; He would have liked
to play with it as a cat plays with a mouse, knowing all the while that
he must refuse in the end.&nbsp; Perhaps Turner had made the offer in
Miriam&rsquo;s presence, expecting to find in her a powerful ally.&nbsp;
It was only natural for him to think this.&nbsp; Ever since the beginning,
men have assigned to women the role of the dissuader, the drag, the
hinderer.&nbsp; It is always the woman, tradition tells us, who persuades
the man to be a coward, to stay at home, to shirk a difficult or a dangerous
duty.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Turner had made this mistake.&nbsp; He had always
wondered why Miriam Liston elected to live at Farlingford when with
her wealth and connections, both in England and France, she might live
a gayer life elsewhere.&nbsp; There must, he reflected, be some reason
for it.</p>
<p>When whosoever does anything slightly unconventional or leaves undone
what custom and gossip make almost obligatory, a relation or a mere
interfering neighbour is always at hand to wag her head and say there
must be some reason for it.&nbsp; Which means, of course, one specific
reason.&nbsp; And the worst of it is that she is nearly always right.</p>
<p>John Turner, laboriously putting two small numerals together, after
his manner, had concluded that Loo Barebone was the reason.&nbsp; Even
banking may, it seems, be carried on without the loss of all human weakness,
especially if the banker be of middle age, unmarried, and deprived by
an unromantic superfluity of adipose tissue of the possibility of living
through a romance of his own.&nbsp; Turner had consented to countenance,
if not actually to take part in, a nefarious scheme, to rid France and
the present government of one who might easily bring about its downfall,
on certain conditions.&nbsp; Knowing quite well that Loo Barebone could
take care of himself at sea, and was quite capable of effecting an escape
if he desired it, he had put no obstacle in the way of the usual voyage
to the Iceland fisheries.&nbsp; Since those days many governments in
France have invented many new methods of disposing of a political foe.&nbsp;
Dormer Colville was only anticipating events when he took away the character
of the Captain of the &ldquo;Petite Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turner had himself proposed this alternative method of securing Barebone&rsquo;s
silence.&nbsp; He had even named the sum.&nbsp; He had seized the excellent
opportunity of laying it before Barebone in the quiet intimacy of the
rectory drawing-room with Miriam in the soft lamp-light beside him,
with the scent of the violets at her breast mingling with the warm smell
of the wood fire.</p>
<p>And Barebone had laughed at the offer.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.&nbsp; IN THE FURROW AGAIN</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Turner, stumbling along the road to &ldquo;The Black Sailor,&rdquo;
probably wondered why he had failed.&nbsp; It is to be presumed that
he knew that the ally he had looked to for powerful aid had played him
false at the crucial moment.</p>
<p>His misfortune is common to all men who presume to take anything
for granted from a woman.</p>
<p>Barebone, stumbling along in the dark in another direction, was as
angry with Miriam as she in her turn was angry with Turner.&nbsp; She
was, Barebone reflected, so uncompromising.&nbsp; She saw her course
so clearly, so unmistakably&mdash;as birds that fly in the night&mdash;and
from that course nothing, it seemed, would move her.&nbsp; It was a
question of temperament and not of principle.&nbsp; For, even half a
century ago, high principles were beginning to go out of fashion in
the upper strata of a society which in these days tolerates anything
except cheating at games.</p>
<p>Barebone himself was of a different temperament.&nbsp; He liked to
blind himself to the inevitable end, to temporise with the truth, whereas
Miriam, with a sort of dogged courage essentially English, perceived
the hard truth at once and clung to it, though it hurt.&nbsp; And all
the while Barebone knew at the back of his heart that his life was not
his own to shape.&nbsp; At the end, says an Italian motto, stands Destiny.&nbsp;
Barebone wanted to make believe; he wanted to pretend that his path
lay down a flowery way, knowing all the while that he had a hill to
climb and Destiny stood at the top.</p>
<p>Colville had come at the right time.&nbsp; It is the fate of some
men to come at the right moment, just as it is the lot of others never
to be there when they are wanted and their place is filled by a bystander
and an opportunity is gone for ever.&nbsp; Which is always a serious
matter, for God only gives one or two opportunities to each of us.</p>
<p>Colville had come with his ready sympathy, not expressed as the world
expresses its sympathy, in words, but by a hundred little self-abnegations.&nbsp;
He was always ready to act up to the principles of his companion for
the moment or to act up to no principles at all should that companion
be deficient.&nbsp; Moreover, he never took it upon himself to judge
others, but extended to his neighbour a large tolerance, in return for
which he seemed to ask nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a carriage,&rdquo; he said, when on a broader cart-track
they could walk side by side, &ldquo;waiting for me at the roadside
inn at the junction of the two roads.&nbsp; The man brought me from
Ipswich to the outskirts of Farlingford, and I sent him back to the
high road to wait for me there, to put up and stay all night, if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone was beginning to feel tired.&nbsp; The wind was abominably
cold.&nbsp; He heard with satisfaction that Colville had as usual foreseen
his wishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dogged Turner all the way from Paris, hardly letting him
out of my sight,&rdquo; Colville explained, cheerily, when they at length
reached the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is easy enough to keep in touch with
one so remarkably stout, for every one remembers him.&nbsp; What did
he come to Farlingford for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently to try and buy me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Louis Bonaparte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;He would not say so.&nbsp;
But it is pretty generally suspected that he is in that galley, and
pulls an important oar in it, too.&nbsp; What did he offer you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled Colville.&nbsp; He stopped short in
the middle of the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he repeated, thoughtfully,
&ldquo;fifty thousand pounds!&nbsp; Gad!&nbsp; They must be afraid of
you.&nbsp; They must think that we are in a strong position.&nbsp; And
what did you say, Barebone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone paused, and after a moment&rsquo;s thought made no answer
at all.&nbsp; He could not explain to Dormer Colville his reason for
refusing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outright?&rdquo; inquired Colville, deep in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville turned and glanced at him sideways, though it was too dark
to see his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought,&rdquo; he said, tentatively, after
a while, &ldquo;that it would have been wise to accept.&nbsp; A bird
in the hand, you know&mdash;a damned big bird!&nbsp; And then afterwards
you could see what turned up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I could break my word later on,&rdquo; inquired Barebone,
with that odd downrightness which at times surprised Colville and made
him think of Captain Clubbe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; he explained, with a tolerant laugh,
&ldquo;in politics it often turns out that a man&rsquo;s duty is to
break his word&mdash;duty toward his party, and his country, and that
sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was plausible enough, as many eminent politicians seem to have
found in these later times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it may be so,&rdquo; answered Barebone, &ldquo;but
I refused outright, and there is an end to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For now that he was brought face to face with the situation, shorn
of side issues and set squarely before him, he envisaged it clearly
enough.&nbsp; He did not want fifty thousand pounds.&nbsp; He had only
wanted the money for a moment because the thought leapt into his mind
that fifty thousand pounds meant Miriam.&nbsp; Then he saw that little
contemptuous smile tilting the corner of her lips, and he had no use
for a million.</p>
<p>If he could not have Miriam, he would be King of France.&nbsp; It
is thus that history is made, for those who make it are only men.&nbsp;
And Clio, that greatest of the daughters of Zeus, about whose feet cluster
all the famous names of the makers of this world&rsquo;s story, has,
after all, only had the reversion of the earth&rsquo;s great men.&nbsp;
She has taken them after some forgotten woman of their own choosing
has had the first refusal.</p>
<p>Thus it came about that the friendship so nearly severed one evening
at the Hotel Gemosac, in Paris, was renewed after a few months; and
Barebone felt assured once more that no one was so well disposed toward
him as Dormer Colville.</p>
<p>There was no formal reconciliation, and neither deemed it necessary
to refer to the past.&nbsp; Colville, it will be remembered, was an
adept at that graceful tactfulness which is somewhat clumsily described
by this tolerant generation as going on as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>By the time that the waning moon was high enough in the eastern sky
to shed an appreciable light upon their path, they reached the junction
of the two roads and set off at a brisk pace southward toward Ipswich.&nbsp;
So far as the eye could reach, the wide heath was deserted, and they
talked at their ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing for it but to wake up my driver and make
him take us back to Ipswich to-night.&nbsp; To-morrow morning we can
take train to London and be there almost as soon as John Turner realises
that you have given him the slip,&rdquo; said Colville, cheerily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then back to France&mdash;where the sun shines, my friend,
and the spring is already in the air.&nbsp; Think of that!&nbsp; It
is so, at least, at Gemosac, for I heard from the Marquis before I quitted
Paris.&nbsp; Your disappearance has nearly broken a heart or two down
there, I can tell you.&nbsp; The old Marquis was in a great state of
anxiety.&nbsp; I have never seen him so upset about anything, and Juliette
did not seem to be able to offer him any consolation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to France?&rdquo; echoed Barebone, not without a tone
of relief, almost of exultation, in his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will it
be possible to go back there, since we have to run away from Farlingford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safer there than here,&rdquo; replied Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
may sound odd, but it is true.&nbsp; De Gemosac is one of the most powerful
men in France&mdash;not intellectually, perhaps, but by reason of his
great name&mdash;and they would not dare to touch a prot&eacute;g&eacute;
or a guest of his.&nbsp; If you go back there now you must stay at Gemosac;
they have put the ch&acirc;teau into a more habitable condition, and
are ready to receive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and glanced at Loo&rsquo;s face in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a difference, you understand.&nbsp; You will
be a different person from what you were when last there,&rdquo; he
went on, in a muffled voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand,&rdquo; replied Barebone, gravely.&nbsp;
Already the dream was taking shape&mdash;Colville&rsquo;s persuasive
voice had awakened him to find that it was no dream, but a reality&mdash;and
Farlingford was fading back into the land of shadows.&nbsp; It was only
France, after all, that was real.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That journey of ours,&rdquo; explained Colville, vaguely,
&ldquo;has made an extraordinary difference.&nbsp; The whole party is
aroused and in deadly earnest now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barebone made no answer, and they walked on in meditative silence
toward the roadside inn, which stood up against the southern sky a few
hundred yards ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; Colville added, after a silence, &ldquo;the
ball is at your feet, Barebone.&nbsp; There can be no looking back now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again Barebone made no answer.&nbsp; It was a tacit understanding,
then.</p>
<p>For greater secrecy, Barebone walked on toward Ipswich alone, while
Colville went into the inn to arouse his driver, whom he found slumbering
in the wide chimney corner before a log fire.&nbsp; From Ipswich to
London, and thus on to Newhaven, they journeyed pleasantly enough in
company, for they were old companions of the road, and Colville&rsquo;s
unruffled good humour made him an easy comrade for travel even in days
when the idea of comfort reconciled with speed had not suggested itself
to the mind of man.</p>
<p>Such, indeed, was his foresight that he had brought with him to London,
and there left awaiting further need of it, that personal baggage which
Loo had perforce left behind him at the Hotel Gemosac in Paris.</p>
<p>They made but a brief halt in London, where Colville admitted gaily
that he had no desire to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might meet my tailor in Piccadilly,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And there are others who may perhaps consider themselves aggrieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Colville&rsquo;s club, where they dined, he met more than one
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said one who had the ruddy countenance and bluff
manners of a retired major.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hallo!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;d have
expected to see you here?&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;I&mdash;thought&mdash;eh!
dammy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a hundred facetious questions gleamed from the major&rsquo;s
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my boy,&rdquo; answered Colville, cheerfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am off to France to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major shook his head wisely as if in approval of a course of
conduct savouring of that prudence which is the better part of valour,
glanced at Loo Barebone, and waited in vain for an invitation to take
a vacant chair near at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still in the south of France, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still in the south of France,&rdquo; replied Colville, turning
to Barebone in a final way, which had the effect of dismissing this
inquisitive idler.</p>
<p>While they were at dinner another came.&nbsp; He was a raw-boned
Scotchman, who spoke in broken English when the waiter was absent and
in perfect French when that servitor hovered near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could show my face in Paris,&rdquo; he said, frankly,
&ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Too much mixed up with Louis Philippe
to find favour in the eyes of the Prince President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;What could you gain
by showing in Paris a face which I am sure has the stamp of innocence
all over it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scotchman laughed curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gain?&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gain?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
say I would, but I think I might be able to turn an honest penny out
of the approaching events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What events?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord alone knows,&rdquo; replied the Scotchman, who had
never set foot in his country, but had acquired elsewhere the prudent
habit of never answering a question.&nbsp; &ldquo;France doesn&rsquo;t,
I am sure of that.&nbsp; I am thinking there will be events, though,
before long, Colville.&nbsp; Will there not, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville looked at him with an open smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;the Prince President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what he calls himself at present.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
wondering how long.&nbsp; Eh! man.&nbsp; He is just pouring money into
the country from here, from America, from Austria&mdash;from wherever
he can get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is he doing that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must ask somebody who knows him better than I do.&nbsp;
They say you knew him yourself once well enough, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not a man I have much faith in,&rdquo; said Colville,
vaguely.&nbsp; &ldquo;And France has no faith in him at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m told.&nbsp; But France&mdash;well, does France
know what she wants?&nbsp; She mostly wants something without knowing
what it is.&nbsp; She is like a woman.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s excitement she
wants, perhaps.&nbsp; And she will buy it at any cost, and then find
afterward she has paid too dear for it.&nbsp; That is like a woman,
too.&nbsp; But it isn&rsquo;t another Bonaparte she wants, I am sure
of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; answered Colville, with a side glance toward
Barebone, a mere flicker of the eyelids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless it is a Napoleon of that ilk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is not,&rdquo; completed Colville. .</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; the Scotchman paused, for a waiter came
at this moment to tell him that his dinner was ready at a table nearer
to the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on, in French, for the
waiter lingered, &ldquo;but he might be able to persuade France that
it is himself she wants&mdash;might he not, now?&nbsp; With money at
the back of it, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might,&rdquo; admitted Colville, doubtfully.</p>
<p>The Scotchman moved away, but came back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; he said, with a grim smile, &ldquo;that
like all intelligent people who know France, you are aware that it is
a King she wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not an Orleans King,&rdquo; replied Colville, with his
friendly and indifferent laugh.</p>
<p>The Scotchman smiled more grimly still and went away.</p>
<p>He was seated too near for Colville and Loo to talk of him.&nbsp;
But Colville took an opportunity to mention his name in an undertone.&nbsp;
It was a name known all over Europe then, and forgotten now.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.&nbsp; THE THURSDAY OF MADAME DE CHANTONNAY</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Madame de Chantonnay had maintained throughout
the months of January and February&mdash;&ldquo;it is an affair of the
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She continued to hold this opinion with, however, a shade less conviction,
well into a cold March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an affair of the heart, Abb&eacute;,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Allez</i>!&nbsp; I know what I talk of.&nbsp; It is an affair
of the heart and nothing more.&nbsp; There is some one in England: some
blonde English girl.&nbsp; They are always washing, I am told.&nbsp;
And certainly they have that air&mdash;like a garment that has been
too often to the <i>blanchisseuse</i> and has lost its substance.&nbsp;
A beautiful skin, I allow you.&nbsp; But so thin&mdash;so thin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skin, madame?&rdquo; inquired the Abb&eacute; Touvent,
with that gentle and cackling humour in which the ordained of any Church
may indulge after a good dinner.</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; Touvent had, as a matter of fact, been Madame de
Chantonnay&rsquo;s most patient listener through the months of suspense
that followed Loo Barebone&rsquo;s sudden disappearance.&nbsp; Needless
to say he agreed ardently with whatever explanation she put forward.&nbsp;
Old ladies who give good dinners to a Low Church British curate, or
an abb&eacute; of the Roman confession, or, indeed, to the needy celibate
exponents of any creed whatsoever, may always count upon the active
conversational support of their spiritual adviser.&nbsp; And it is not
only within the fold of Papacy that careful Christians find the road
to heaven made smooth by the arts of an efficient cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well enough what I mean, malicious one,&rdquo; retorted
the lady, arranging her shawl upon her fat shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always think,&rdquo; murmured the Abb&eacute;, sipping his
digestive glass of eau-de-vie d&rsquo;Armagnac, which is better than
any cognac of Charente&mdash;&ldquo;I always think that to be thin shows
a mean mind, lacking generosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my word for it,&rdquo; pursued Madame de Chantonnay,
warming to her subject, &ldquo;that is the explanation of the young
man&rsquo;s disappearance.&nbsp; They say the government has taken some
underhand way of putting him aside.&nbsp; One does not give credence
to such rumours in these orderly times.&nbsp; No: it is simply that
he prefers the pale eyes of some Mees to glory and France.&nbsp; Has
it not happened before, Abb&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Madame&mdash;&rdquo; another sip of Armagnac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will it not happen again?&nbsp; It is the heart that has
the first word and the last.&nbsp; I know&mdash;I who address you, I
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she touched her breast where, very deeply seated it is to be
presumed, she kept her own heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Madame.&nbsp; Who better?&rdquo; murmured the Abb&eacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Na, na!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame de Chantonnay, holding up
one hand, heavy with rings, while with the other she gathered her shawl
closer about her as if for protection.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you tread on
dangerous ground, wicked one&mdash;<i>wicked</i>!&nbsp; And you so demure
in your soutane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Abb&eacute; only laughed and held up his small glass after
the manner of any abandoned layman drinking a toast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I drink to the hearts you have
broken.&nbsp; And now I go to arrange the card tables, for your guests
will soon be coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, in fact, Madame de Chantonnay&rsquo;s Thursday evening to
which were bidden such friends as enjoyed for the moment her fickle
good graces.&nbsp; The Abb&eacute; Touvent was, so to speak, a permanent
subscriber to these favours.&nbsp; The task was easy enough, and any
endowed with a patience to listen, a readiness to admire that excellent
young nobleman, Albert de Chantonnay, and the credulity necessary to
listen to the record (more hinted at than clearly spoken) of Madame&rsquo;s
own charms in her youth, could make sure of a game of dominoes on the
evening of the third Thursday in the month.</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; bustled about, drawing cards and tables nearer to
the lamps, away from the draught of the door, not too near the open
wood fire.&nbsp; His movements were dainty, like those of an old maid
of the last generation.&nbsp; He hissed through his teeth as if he were
working very hard.&nbsp; It served to stimulate a healthy excitement
in the Thursday evening of Madame de Chantonnay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am not uneasy,&rdquo; said that lady, as she watched
him.&nbsp; She had dined well and her digestion had outlived those charms
to which she made such frequent reference.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not uneasy.&nbsp;
He will return, more or less sheepish.&nbsp; He will make some excuse
more or less inadequate.&nbsp; He will tell us a story more or less
creditable.&nbsp; <i>Allez</i>!&nbsp; Oh, you men.&nbsp; If you intend
that chair for Monsieur de Gemosac, it is the wrong one.&nbsp; Monsieur
de Gemosac sits high, but his legs are short; give him the little chair
that creaks.&nbsp; If he sits too high he is apt to see over the top
of one&rsquo;s cards.&nbsp; And he is so eager to win&mdash;the good
Marquis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he will come to-night despite the cold?&nbsp; You think
he will come, Madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it.&nbsp; He has come more frequently since Juliette
came to live at the ch&acirc;teau.&nbsp; It is Juliette who makes him
come, perhaps.&nbsp; Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; stopped midway across the floor and set down the
chair he carried with great caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame is incorrigible,&rdquo; he said, spreading out his
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame would perceive a romance in a cradle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one must begin somewhere, Materialist.&nbsp; Once it
was for me that the guests crowded to my poor Thursdays.&nbsp; But now
it is because Albert is near.&nbsp; Ah! I know it.&nbsp; I say it without
jealousy.&nbsp; Have you noticed, my dear Abb&eacute;, that he has cut
his whiskers a little shorter&mdash;a shade nearer to the ear?&nbsp;
It is effective, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives an air of hardihood,&rdquo; assented the Abb&eacute;.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It lends to that intellectual face something martial.&nbsp; I
would almost say that to the timorous it might appear terrible and overbearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus they talked until the guests began to arrive, and for Madame
de Chantonnay the time no doubt seemed short enough.&nbsp; For no one
appreciated Albert with such a delicacy of touch as the Abb&eacute;
Touvent.</p>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac and Juliette were the last to arrive.&nbsp;
The Marquis looked worn and considerably aged.&nbsp; He excused himself
with a hundred gestures of despair for being late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have so much to do,&rdquo; he whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
much to think of.&nbsp; We are leaving no stone unturned, and at last
we have a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other guests gathered round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But speak, my dear friend, speak,&rdquo; cried Madame de Chantonnay.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You keep us in suspense.&nbsp; Look around you.&nbsp; We are
among friends, as you see.&nbsp; It is only ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the Marquis, standing upright and fingering
the snuff-box which had been given to his grandfather by the Great Louis.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, my friends, our invaluable ally, Dormer Colville, has gone
to England.&nbsp; There is a ray of hope.&nbsp; That is all I can tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked round, smiled on his audience, and then proceeded to tell
them more, after the manner of any Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;if an unscrupulous republican
government had got scent of our glorious discovery!&nbsp; What if, panic-stricken,
they threw all vestige of honour to the wind and decided to kidnap an
innocent man and send him to the Iceland fisheries, where so many lives
are lost every winter; with what hopes in their republican hearts, I
leave to your imagination.&nbsp; What if&mdash;let us say it for once&mdash;Monsieur
de Bourbon should prove a match for them?&nbsp; Alert, hardy, full of
resource, a skilled sailor, he takes his life in his hand with the daring
audacity of royal blood and effects his escape to England.&nbsp; I tell
you nothing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up his hands as if to stay their clamouring voices, and nodded
his head triumphantly toward Albert de Chantonnay, who stood near a
lamp fingering his martial whisker of the left side with the air of
one who would pause at naught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you nothing.&nbsp; But such a theory has been pieced
together upon excellent material.&nbsp; It may be true.&nbsp; It may
be a dream.&nbsp; And, as I tell you, our dear friend Dormer Colville,
who has nothing at stake, who loses or gains little by the restoration
of France, has journeyed to England for us.&nbsp; None could execute
the commission so capably, or without danger of arousing suspicion.&nbsp;
There!&nbsp; I have told you all I know.&nbsp; We must wait, my compatriots.&nbsp;
We must wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the mean time,&rdquo; purred the voice of the Abb&eacute;
Touvent, &ldquo;for the digestion, Monsieur le Marquis&mdash;for the
digestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For it was one of the features of Madame de Chantonnay&rsquo;s Thursdays
that no servants were allowed in the room; but the guests waited on
each other.&nbsp; If the servants, as is to be presumed, listened outside
the door, they were particular not to introduce each succeeding guest
without first knocking, which caused a momentary silence and added considerably
to the sense of political importance of those assembled.&nbsp; The Abb&eacute;
Touvent made it his special care to preside over the table where small
glasses of eau-de-vie d&rsquo;Armagnac and other aids to digestion were
set out in a careful profusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a theory, my dear Marquis,&rdquo; admitted Madame de
Chantonnay.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is nothing more.&nbsp; It has no heart
in it, your theory.&nbsp; Now I have a theory of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full of heart, one may assure oneself, Madame; full of heart,&rdquo;
murmured the Marquis.&nbsp; &ldquo;For you yourself are full of heart&mdash;is
it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Juliette whispered to her fan, with a little
smile of malicious amusement.&nbsp; For she had a youthful contempt
for persons old and stout, who talk ignorantly of matters only understood
by such as are young and slim and pretty.&nbsp; She looked at her fan
with a gleam of ill-concealed irony and glanced over it toward Albert
de Chantonnay, who, with a consideration which must have been hereditary,
was uneasy about the alteration he had made in his whiskers.&nbsp; It
was perhaps unfair, he felt, to harrow young and tender hearts.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that a loud knock commanded a breathless silence,
for no more guests were expected.&nbsp; Indeed the whole neighbourhood
was present.</p>
<p>The servant, in his faded gold lace, came in and announced with a
dramatic assurance: &ldquo;Monsieur de Borbone&mdash;Monsieur Colville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that difference which Dormer Colville had predicted was manifested
with an astounding promptness; for all who were seated rose to their
feet.&nbsp; It was Colville who had given the names to the servant in
the order in which they had been announced, and at the last minute,
on the threshold, he had stepped on one side and with his hand on Barebone&rsquo;s
shoulder had forced him to take precedence.</p>
<p>The first person Barebone saw on entering the room was Juliette,
standing under the spreading arms of a chandelier, half turned to look
at him&mdash;Juliette, in all the freshness of her girlhood and her
first evening dress, flushing pink and white like a wild rose, her eyes,
bright with a sudden excitement, seeking his.</p>
<p>Behind her, the Marquis de Gemosac, Albert de Chantonnay, his mother,
and all the Royalists of the province, gathered in a semicircle, by
accident or some tacit instinct, leaving only the girl standing out
in front, beneath the chandelier.&nbsp; They bowed with that grave self-possession
which falls like a cloak over the shoulders of such as are of ancient
and historic lineage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We reached the ch&acirc;teau of Gemosac only a few minutes
after Monsieur le Marquis and Mademoiselle had quitted it to come here,&rdquo;
Barebone explained to Madame de Chantonnay; &ldquo;and trusting to the
good-nature&mdash;so widely famed&mdash;of Madame la Comtesse, we hurriedly
removed the dust of travel, and took the liberty of following them hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not taken me by surprise,&rdquo; replied Madame de
Chantonnay.&nbsp; &ldquo;I expected you.&nbsp; Ask the Abb&eacute; Touvent.&nbsp;
He will tell you, gentlemen, that I expected you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Barebone turned away to speak to the Marquis and others, who were
pressing forward to greet him, it became apparent that that mantle of
imperturbability, which millions made in trade can never buy, had fallen
upon his shoulders, too.&nbsp; For most men are, in the end, forced
to play the part the world assigns to them.&nbsp; We are not allowed
to remain what we know ourselves to be, but must, at last, be that which
the world thinks us.</p>
<p>Madame de Chantonnay, murmuring to a neighbour a mystic reference
to her heart and its voluminous premonitions, watched him depart with
a vague surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu! mon Dieu</i>!&rdquo; she whispered, breathlessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not a resemblance.&nbsp; It is the dead come to life again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.&nbsp; PRIMROSES</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;If I go on, I go alone,&rdquo; Barebone had once said to Dormer
Colville.&nbsp; The words, spoken in the heat of a quarrel, stuck in
the memory of both, as such are wont to do.&nbsp; Perhaps, in moments
of anger or disillusionment&mdash;when we find that neither self nor
friend is what we thought&mdash;the heart tears itself away from the
grip of the cooler, calmer brain and speaks untrammelled.&nbsp; And
such speeches are apt to linger in the mind long after the most brilliant
jeu d&rsquo;esprit has been forgotten.</p>
<p>What occupies the thoughts of the old man, sitting out the grey remainder
of the day, over the embers of a hearth which he will only quit when
he quits the world?&nbsp; Does he remember the brilliant sallies of
wit, the greatest triumphs of the noblest minds with which he has consorted;
or does his memory cling to some scene&mdash;simple, pastoral, without
incident&mdash;which passed before his eyes at a moment when his heart
was sore or glad?&nbsp; When his mind is resting from its labours and
the sound of the grinding is low, he will scarce remember the neat saying
or the lofty thought clothed in perfect language; but he will never
forget a hasty word spoken in an unguarded moment by one who was not
clever at all, nor even possessed the worldly wisdom to shield the heart
behind the buckler of the brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find things changed,&rdquo; Colville had said, as
they walked across the marsh from Farlingford, toward the Ipswich road.&nbsp;
And the words came back to the minds of both, on that Thursday of Madame
de Chantonnay, which many remember to this day.&nbsp; Not only did they
find things changed, but themselves they found no longer the same.&nbsp;
Both remembered the quarrel, and the outcome of it.</p>
<p>Colville, ever tolerant, always leaning toward the compromise that
eases a doubting conscience, had, it would almost seem unconsciously,
prepared the way for a reconciliation before there was any question
of a difference.&nbsp; On their way back to France, without directly
referring to that fatal portrait and the revelation caused by Barebone&rsquo;s
unaccountable feat of memory, he had smoothed away any possible scruple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;France must always be deceived,&rdquo; he had said, a hundred
times.&nbsp; &ldquo;Better that she should be deceived for an honest
than a dishonest purpose&mdash;if it is deception, after all, which
is very doubtful.&nbsp; The best patriot is he who is ready to save
his country at the cost of his own ease, whether of body or of mind.&nbsp;
It does not matter who or what you are; it is what or who the world
thinks you to be, that is of importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which of us has not listened to a score of such arguments, not always
from the lips of a friend, but most often in that still, small voice
which rarely has the courage to stand out against the tendency of the
age?&nbsp; There is nothing so contagious as laxity of conscience.</p>
<p>Barebone listened to the good-natured, sympathetic voice with a make-believe
conviction which was part of his readiness to put off an evil moment.&nbsp;
Colville was a difficult man to quarrel with.&nbsp; It seemed bearish
and ill-natured to take amiss any word or action which could only be
the outcome of a singularly tender consideration for the feelings of
others.</p>
<p>But when they entered Madame de Chantonnay&rsquo;s drawing-room&mdash;when
Dormer, impelled by some instinct of the fitness of things, stepped
aside and motioned to his companion to pass in first&mdash;the secret
they had in common yawned suddenly like a gulf between them.&nbsp; For
the possession of a secret either estranges or draws together.&nbsp;
More commonly, it estranges.&nbsp; For which of us is careful of a secret
that redounds to our credit?&nbsp; Nearly every secret is a hidden disgrace;
and such a possession, held in common with another, is not likely to
insure affection.</p>
<p>Colville lingered on the threshold, watching Loo make the first steps
of that progress which must henceforth be pursued alone.&nbsp; He looked
round for a friendly face, but no one had eyes for him.&nbsp; They were
all looking at Loo Barebone.&nbsp; Colville sought Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence,
usually in full evidence, even in a room full of beautiful women and
distinguished men.&nbsp; But she was not there.&nbsp; For a minute or
two no one noticed him; and then Albert de Chantonnay, remembering his
r&ocirc;le, came forward to greet the Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; explained Colville, in a lowered voice, &ldquo;as
we thought.&nbsp; An attempt was made to get him out of the way, but
he effected his escape.&nbsp; He knew, however, the danger of attempting
to communicate with any of us by post, and was awaiting some opportunity
of transmitting a letter by a safe hand, when I discovered his hiding-place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was the story that went half round France, from lip to lip,
among those who were faithful to the traditions of a glorious past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame St. Pierre Lawrence,&rdquo; Albert de Chantonnay told
Colville, in reply, &ldquo;is not here to-night.&nbsp; She is, however,
at her villa, at Royan.&nbsp; She has not, perhaps, displayed such interest
in our meetings as she did before you departed on your long journey
through France.&nbsp; But her generosity is unchanged.&nbsp; The money,
which, in the hurry of the moment, you did not withdraw from her bank&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt whether it was ever there,&rdquo; interrupted Colville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She informs me,&rdquo; concluded Albert, &ldquo;is still at
our service.&nbsp; We have many other promises, which must now be recalled
to the minds of those who made them.&nbsp; But from no one have we received
such generous support as from your kinswoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were standing apart, and in a few minutes the Marquis de Gemosac
joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How daring! how audacious!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;and
yet how opportune&mdash;this return.&nbsp; It is all to be recommenced,
my friends, with a firmer grasp, a new courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my task is accomplished,&rdquo; returned Colville.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have no further use for a mere Englishman, like myself.&nbsp;
I was fortunate in being able to lend some slight assistance in the
original discovery of our friend; I have again been lucky enough to
restore him to you.&nbsp; And now, with your permission, I will return
to Royan, where I have my little apartment, as you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked from one to the other, with his melancholy and self-deprecating
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Voil&aacute;</i>,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;it remains for
me to pay my respects to Madame de Chantonnay.&nbsp; We have travelled
far, and I am tired.&nbsp; I shall ask her to excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Monsieur de Bourbon comes to Gemosac.&nbsp; That is understood.&nbsp;
He will be safe there.&nbsp; His apartments have been in readiness for
him these last two months.&nbsp; Hidden there, or in other dwellings&mdash;grander
and better served, perhaps, than my poor ruin, but no safer&mdash;he
can continue the great work he began so well last winter.&nbsp; As for
you, my dear Colville,&rdquo; continued the Marquis, taking the Englishman&rsquo;s
two hands in his, &ldquo;I envy you from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp;
It is not given to many to serve France as you have served her&mdash;to
serve a King as you have served one.&nbsp; It will be my business to
see that both remember you.&nbsp; For France, I allow, sometimes forgets.&nbsp;
Go to Royan, since you wish&mdash;but it is only for a time.&nbsp; You
will be called to Paris some day, that I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis would have embraced him then and there, had the cool-blooded
Englishman shown the smallest desire for that honour.&nbsp; But Dormer
Colville&rsquo;s sad and doubting smile held at arms&rsquo; length one
who was always at the mercy of his own eloquence.</p>
<p>The card tables had lost their attraction; and, although many parties
were formed, and the cards were dealt, the players fell to talking across
the ungathered tricks, and even the Abb&eacute; Touvent was caught tripping
in the matter of a point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; exclaimed Madame de Chantonnay, as her guests
took leave at their wonted hour, and some of them even later&mdash;&ldquo;never
have I had a Thursday so dull and yet so full of incident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And never, madame,&rdquo; replied the Marquis, still on tiptoe,
as it were, with delight and excitement, &ldquo;shall we see another
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loo went back to Gemosac with the fluttering old man and Juliette.&nbsp;
Juliette, indeed, was in no flutter, but had carried herself through
the excitement of her first evening party with a demure little air of
self-possession.</p>
<p>She had scarce spoken to Loo during the evening.&nbsp; Indeed, it
had been his duty to attend on Madame de Chantonnay and on the older
members of these quiet Royalist families biding their time in the remote
country villages of Guienne and the Vend&eacute;e.</p>
<p>On the journey home, the Marquis had so much to tell his companion,
and told it so hurriedly, that his was the only voice heard above the
rattle of the heavy, old-fashioned carriage.&nbsp; But Barebone was
aware of Juliette&rsquo;s presence in a dark corner of the roomy vehicle,
and his eyes, seeking to penetrate the gloom, could just distinguish
hers, which seemed to be turned in his direction.</p>
<p>Many changes had been effected at the ch&acirc;teau, and a suite
of rooms had been prepared for Barebone in the detached building known
as the Italian house, which stands in the midst of the garden within
the enceinte of the ch&acirc;teau walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been able,&rdquo; explained the Marquis, frankly, &ldquo;to
obtain a small advance on the results of last autumn&rsquo;s vintage.&nbsp;
My notary in the village found, indeed, that facilities were greater
than he had anticipated.&nbsp; With this sum, I have been enabled to
effect some necessary repairs to the buildings and the internal decorations.&nbsp;
I had fallen behind the times, perhaps.&nbsp; But now that Juliette
is installed as ch&acirc;telaine, many changes have been effected.&nbsp;
You will see, my dear friend; you will see for yourself.&nbsp; Yes,
for the moment, I am no longer a pauper.&nbsp; As you yourself will
have noticed, in your journey through the west, rural France is enjoying
a sudden return of prosperity.&nbsp; It is unaccountable.&nbsp; No one
can make me believe that it is to be ascribed to this scandalous Government,
under which we agonise.&nbsp; But there it is&mdash;and we must thank
Heaven for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was only the truth.&nbsp; For France was at this time entering
upon a period of plenty.&nbsp; The air was full of rumours of new railways,
new roads, and new commercial enterprise.&nbsp; Banks were being opened
in the provincial towns, and loans made on easy terms to agriculturists
for the improvement of their land.</p>
<p>Barebone found that there were indeed changes in the old ch&acirc;teau.&nbsp;
The apartments above that which had once been the stabling, hitherto
occupied by the Marquis, had been added to and a slight attempt at redecoration
had been made.&nbsp; There was no lack of rooms, and Juliette now had
her own suite, while the Marquis lived, as hitherto, in three small
apartments over the rooms occupied by Marie and her husband.</p>
<p>An elderly relation&mdash;one of those old ladies habited in black,
who are ready to efface themselves all day and occupy a garret all night
in return for bed and board, had been added to the family.&nbsp; She
contributed a silent and mysterious presence, some worldly wisdom, and
a profound respect for her noble kinsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is quite harmless,&rdquo; Juliette explained, gaily, to
Barebone, on the first occasion when they were alone together.&nbsp;
This did not present itself until Loo had been quartered in the Italian
house for some days, with his own servant.&nbsp; Although he took luncheon
and dinner with the family in the old building near to the gate-house,
and spent his evenings in Juliette&rsquo;s drawing-room, the Marquis
or Madame Maugiron was always present, and as often as not, they played
a game of chess together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is quite harmless,&rdquo; said Juliette, tying, with a
thread, the primroses she had been picking in that shady corner of the
garden which lay at the other side of the Italian house.&nbsp; The windows
of Barebone&rsquo;s apartment, by the way, looked down upon this garden,
and he, having perceived her, had not wasted time in joining her in
the morning sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I shall be as harmless when I am her age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, indeed, danger lurked beneath her lashes as she glanced at him,
asking this question with her lips and a hundred others with her eyes,
with her gay air of youth and happiness&mdash;with her very attitude
of coquetry, as she stood in the spring sunshine, with the scent of
the primroses about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that any one who approaches you will always do so
at his peril, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do it?&rdquo; she asked, drawing back and busying
herself with the flowers, which she laid against her breast, as if to
judge the effect of their colour against the delicate white of her dress.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why run into danger?&nbsp; Why come downstairs at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why breathe?&rdquo; he retorted, with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
eat, or drink, or sleep?&nbsp; Why live?&nbsp; <i>Mon Dieu</i>! because
there is no choice.&nbsp; And when I see you in the garden, there is
no choice for me, Mademoiselle.&nbsp; I must come down and run into
danger, because I cannot help it any more that I can help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you need not stay,&rdquo; she interrupted, cleverly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A brave man may always retire from danger into safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he may not always want to, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, with a shrug of the shoulders, she inserted the primroses within
a very small waistband and turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me those primroses, Mademoiselle?&rdquo; asked
Loo, without moving; for, although she had turned to go, she had not
gone.</p>
<p>She turned on her heel and looked at him, with demure surprise, and
then bent her head to look at the flowers at her own waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are mine,&rdquo; she answered, standing in that pretty
attitude, her hair half concealing her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I picked them
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two reasons why I want them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but,&rdquo; she said, with a suggestion of thoughtfulness,
&ldquo;one does not always get what one wants.&nbsp; You ask a great
deal, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no limit to what I would ask, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo; she inquired, with raised eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I dared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she looked at him with that little air of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you were so brave?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
reckless of danger?&nbsp; A brave man assuredly does not ask.&nbsp;
He takes that which he would have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened that she had clasped her hands behind her back, leaving
the primroses at her waist uncovered and half falling from the ribbon.</p>
<p>In a moment he had reached out his hand and taken them.&nbsp; She
leapt back, as if she feared that he might take more, and ran back toward
the house, placing a rough tangle of brier between herself and this
robber.&nbsp; Her laughing face looked at him through the brier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your primroses,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I did
not give them to you.&nbsp; You want too much, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want what that ribbon binds,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; But
she turned away and ran toward the house, without waiting to hear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.&nbsp; DORMER COLVILLE IS BLIND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It was late when Dormer Colville reached the quiet sea-coast village
of Royan on the evening of his return to the west.&nbsp; He did not
seek Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence until the luncheon hour next morning,
when he was informed that she was away from home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame has gone to Paris,&rdquo; the man said, who, with his
wife, was left in charge of the empty house.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a sudden
resolution, one must conclude,&rdquo; he added, darkly, &ldquo;but Madame
took no one into her confidence.&nbsp; She received news by post, which
must have brought about this sudden decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville was intimately acquainted with his cousin&rsquo;s affairs;
many hazarded an opinion that, without the help of Madame St. Pierre
Lawrence, this rolling stone would have been bare enough.&nbsp; She
had gone to Paris for one of two reasons, he concluded.&nbsp; Either
she had expected him to return thither from London, and had gone to
meet him with the intention of coming to some arrangement as to the
disposal of the vast sum of money now in Turner&rsquo;s hands awaiting
further developments, or some hitch had occurred with respect to John
Turner himself.</p>
<p>Dormer Colville returned, thoughtfully, to his lodging, and in the
evening set out for Paris.</p>
<p>He himself had not seen Turner since that morning in the banker&rsquo;s
office in the Rue Lafayette, when they had parted so unceremoniously,
in a somewhat heated spirit.&nbsp; But, on reflection, Colville, who
had sought to reassure himself with regard to one whose name stood for
the incarnation of gastronomy and mental density in the Anglo-French
clubs of Paris, had come to the conclusion that nothing was to be gained
by forcing a quarrel upon Turner.&nbsp; It was impossible to bring home
to him an accusation of complicity in an outrage which had been carried
through with remarkable skill.&nbsp; And when it is impossible to force
home an accusation, a wise man will hold his tongue.</p>
<p>Colville could not prove that Turner had known Barebone to be in
the carriage waiting in the courtyard, and his own action in the matter
had been limited to the interposition of his own clumsy person between
Colville and the window; which might, after all, have been due to stupidity.&nbsp;
This, as a matter of fact, was Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence&rsquo;s theory
on the subject.&nbsp; For that lady, resting cheerfully on the firm
basis of a self-confidence which the possession of money nearly always
confers on women, had laughed at Turner all her life, and now proposed
to continue that course of treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my word,&rdquo; she had assured Colville, &ldquo;he was
only acting in his usual dense way, and probably thinks now that you
are subject to brief fits of mental aberration.&nbsp; I am not afraid
of him or anything that he can do.&nbsp; Leave him to me, and devote
all your attention to finding Loo Barebone again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon which advice Colville had been content to act.&nbsp; He had
a faith in Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence&rsquo;s wit which was almost as
great as her own; and thought, perhaps rightly enough, that if any one
were a match for John Turner it was his sprightly and capable client.&nbsp;
For there are two ways of getting on in this world: one is to get credit
for being cleverer than you are, and the other to be cleverer than your
neighbour suspects.&nbsp; But the latter plan is seldom followed, for
the satisfaction it provides must necessarily be shared with no confidant.</p>
<p>Colville knew where to look for Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence in Paris,
where she always took an apartment in a quiet and old-fashioned hotel
rejoicing in a select Royalist <i>client&egrave;le</i> on the Place
Vend&ocirc;me.&nbsp; On arriving at the capital, he hurried thither,
and was told that the lady he sought had gone out a few minutes earlier.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But Madame&rsquo;s maid,&rdquo; the porter added, &ldquo;is no
doubt within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville was conducted to Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence&rsquo;s room,
and was hardly there before the lady&rsquo;s French maid came hurrying
in with upraised hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A just Heaven has assuredly sent Monsieur at this moment!&rdquo;
she exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame only quitted this room ten minutes
ago, and she was agitated&mdash;she, who is usually so calm.&nbsp; She
would tell me nothing; but I know&mdash;I, who have done Madame&rsquo;s
hair these ten years!&nbsp; And there is only one thing that could cause
her anxiety&mdash;except, of course, any mishap to Monsieur; that would
touch the heart&mdash;yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind, Catherine,&rdquo; said Colville, with a
laugh, &ldquo;to think me so important.&nbsp; Is that letter for me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he pointed to a note in the woman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;yes!&rdquo; was the reply, and she gave up the letter,
somewhat reluctantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is only one thing, and that
is money,&rdquo; she concluded, watching him tear open the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to John Turner&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; Mrs. St.
Pierre Lawrence wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;If, by some lucky chance, you should
pass through Paris, and happen to call this morning, follow me to the
Rue Lafayette.&nbsp; M. St. P. L.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was plain enough.&nbsp; Colville reflected that Mrs. St. Pierre
Lawrence had heard of the success of his mission to England and the
safe return to Gemosac of Loo Barebone.&nbsp; For the moment, he could
not think how the news could have reached her.&nbsp; She might have
heard it from Miriam Liston; for their journey back to Gemosac had occupied
nearly a week.&nbsp; On learning the good news, Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence
had promptly grasped the situation; for she was very quick in thought
and deed.&nbsp; The money would be wanted at once.&nbsp; She had gone
to Turner&rsquo;s office to withdraw it in person.</p>
<p>Dormer Colville bought a flower in a shop in the Rue de la Paix,
and had it affixed to his buttonhole by the handmaid of Flora, who made
it her business to linger over the office with a gentle familiarity
no doubt pleasing enough to the majority of her clients.</p>
<p>Colville was absent-minded as he drove, in a hired carriage, to the
Rue Lafayette.&nbsp; He was wondering whether Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence&rsquo;s
maid had any grounds for stating that a mishap to him would touch her
mistress&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; He was a man of unbounded enterprise;
but, like many who are gamblers at heart, he was superstitious.&nbsp;
He had never dared to try his luck with Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence.&nbsp;
She was so hard, so worldly, so infinitely capable of managing her own
affairs and regulating her own life, that to offer her his hand and
heart in exchange for her fortune had hitherto been dismissed from his
mind as a last expedient, only to be faced when ruin awaited him.</p>
<p>She had only been a widow three years.&nbsp; She had never been a
sentimental woman, and now her liberty and her wealth were obviously
so dear to her that, in common sense, he could scarcely, with any prospect
of success, ask her outright to part with them.&nbsp; Moreover, Mrs.
St. Pierre Lawrence knew all about Dormer Colville, as men say.&nbsp;
Which is only a saying; for no human being knows all about another human
being, nor one-half, nor one-tenth of what there is to know.&nbsp; Mrs.
St. Pierre Lawrence knew enough, at all events, Colville reflected,
rather ruefully, to disillusionise a schoolgirl, much more a woman of
the world, knowing good and evil.</p>
<p>He had not lived forty years in the world, and twenty years in that
world of French culture which digs and digs into human nature, without
having heard philosophers opine that, in matters of the heart, women
have no illusions at all, and that it is only men who go blindfold into
the tortuous ways of love.&nbsp; But he was too practical a man to build
up a false hope on so frail a basis as a theory applied to a woman&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>He bought a flower for his buttonhole then, and squared his shoulders,
without any definite design.&nbsp; It was a mere habit&mdash;the habit
acquired by twenty years of unsuccessful enterprise, and renewed effort
and deferred hope&mdash;of leaving no stone unturned.</p>
<p>His cab wheeled into the Rue Lafayette, and the man drove more slowly,
reading the numbers on the houses.&nbsp; Then he stopped altogether,
and turned round in his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is a great crowd at
the house you named.&nbsp; It extends half across the street.&nbsp;
I will go no further.&nbsp; It is not I who care about publicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville stood up and looked in the direction indicated by his driver&rsquo;s
whip.&nbsp; The man had scarcely exaggerated.&nbsp; A number of people
were waiting their turn on the pavement and out into the roadway, while
two gendarmes held the door.&nbsp; Dormer Colville paid his cabman and
walked into that crowd, with a sinking heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the great English banker,&rdquo; explained an on-looker,
even before he was asked, &ldquo;who has failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville had never found any difficulty in making his way through
a crowd&mdash;a useful accomplishment in Paris at all times, where government
is conducted, thrones are raised and toppled over, provinces are won
and lost again, by the mob.&nbsp; He had that air of distinction which,
if wielded good-naturedly, is the surest passport in any concourse.&nbsp;
Some, no doubt, recognised him as an Englishman.&nbsp; One after another
made way for him.&nbsp; Persons unknown to him commanded others to step
aside and let him pass; for the busybody we have always with us.</p>
<p>In a few minutes he was at the top of the stairs, and there elbowed
his way into the office, where the five clerks sat bent up over their
ledgers.&nbsp; The space on the hither side of the counter was crammed
with men, who whispered impatiently together.&nbsp; If any one raised
his voice, the clerk whose business it was lifted his head and looked
at the speaker with a mute surprise.</p>
<p>One after another these white-faced applicants leant over the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Voyons</i>, Monsieur!&rdquo; they urged; &ldquo;tell me
this or inform me of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the clerk only smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, Monsieur,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot
tell you yet.&nbsp; We are awaiting advices from London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when will you receive them?&rdquo; inquired several, at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be to-morrow.&nbsp; It may not be for several days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can one see Mr. Turner?&rdquo; inquired one, more daring
than the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colville caught the eye of the clerk, and by a gesture made it known
that he must be allowed to pass on into the inner room.&nbsp; Once more
his air of the great world, his good clothes, his flower in the buttonhole,
gave him the advantage over others; and the clerk got down from his
stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence is with him, I know,&rdquo; whispered
Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come by appointment to meet her here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was shown in without further trouble, and found Mrs. St. Pierre
Lawrence sitting, white-faced and voluble, in the visitors&rsquo; chair.</p>
<p>John Turner had his usual air of dense placidity, but the narrow
black tie he always tied in a bow was inclined slightly to one side;
his hair was ruffled, and, although the weather was not warm, his face
wore a shiny look.&nbsp; Any banker, with his clients clamouring on
the stairs and out into the street, might look as John Turner looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard the news?&rdquo; asked Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence,
turning sharply in her chair and looking at Colville with an expression
of sudden relief.&nbsp; She carried a handkerchief in her hand, but
her eyes were dry.&nbsp; She was, after all, only a forerunner of those
who now propose to manage human affairs.&nbsp; And even in these later
days of their great advance, they have not left their pocket-handkerchiefs
behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told by one of the crowd,&rdquo; replied Colville, with
a side smile full of sympathy for Turner, &ldquo;that the&mdash;er&mdash;bank
had come to grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was just telling Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence,&rdquo; said Turner,
imperturbably, &ldquo;that it is too early in the day to throw up the
sponge and cry out that all is lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All!&rdquo; echoed Colville, angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;But do
you mean to say&mdash;&nbsp; Why, surely, there is generally something
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turner shrugged his shoulders and sat in silence, gnawing the middle
joint of his thumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must have the money!&rdquo; cried Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is most important, and I must have it at once.&nbsp; I withdraw
it all.&nbsp; See, I brought my cheque-book with me.&nbsp; And I know
that there are over a hundred thousand pounds in my account.&nbsp; As
well as that, you hold securities for two hundred and fifty thousand
more&mdash;my whole fortune.&nbsp; The money is not yours: it is mine.&nbsp;
I draw it all out, and I insist on having it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turner continued to bite his thumb, and glanced at her without speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, damn it all, Turner!&rdquo; said Colville, in a voice
suddenly hoarse; &ldquo;hand it over, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you it is gone,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; Three hundred and fifty thousand pounds?&nbsp;
Then you are a rogue!&nbsp; You are a fraudulent trustee!&nbsp; I always
thought you were a damned scoundrel, Turner, and now I know it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll get you to the galleys for the rest of your life, I promise
you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will gain nothing by that,&rdquo; returned the banker,
staring at the date-card in front of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you will
lose any chance there is of recovering something from the wreck.&nbsp;
Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence had better take the advice of her lawyer&mdash;in
preference to yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am ruined!&rdquo; said that lady, rising, with an air
of resolution.&nbsp; She was brave, at all events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the present moment, it looks like it,&rdquo; admitted Turner,
without meeting her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; murmured Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence,
looking helplessly round the room and finally at the banker&rsquo;s
stolid face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the rest of us, I suppose,&rdquo; he admitted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Begin the world afresh.&nbsp; Perhaps your friends will come
forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he looked calmly toward Colville.&nbsp; Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence&rsquo;s
face suddenly flushed, and she turned away toward the door.&nbsp; Turner
rose, laboriously, and opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another staircase through this side door,&rdquo;
he said, opening a second door, which had the appearance of a cupboard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can avoid the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed out together, and Turner, having closed the door behind
them, crossed the room to where a small mirror was suspended.&nbsp;
He set his tie straight and smoothed his hair, and then returned to
his chair, with a vague smile on his face.</p>
<p>Colville took the vacant seat in Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence&rsquo;s
brougham.&nbsp; She still held a handkerchief in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not mind for myself,&rdquo; she exclaimed, suddenly,
when the carriage moved out of the court-yard.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is only
for your sake, Dormer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and glanced at him with eyes that shone, but not with
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; she asked, in
a whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Dormer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A way out of it?&rdquo; he answered, hurriedly, almost interrupting
her.&nbsp; He withdrew his hand, upon which she had laid her own; withdrew
it sympathetically, almost tenderly.&nbsp; &ldquo;See a way out of it?&rdquo;
he repeated, in a reflective and business-like voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
I am afraid, for the moment, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat stroking his moustache, looking out of the window, while she
looked out of the other, resolutely blinking back her tears.&nbsp; They
drove back to her hotel without speaking.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.&nbsp; A SORDID MATTER</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bon Dieu</i>! my old friend, what do you expect?&rdquo;
replied Madame de Chantonnay to a rather incoherent statement made to
her one May afternoon by the Marquis de Gemosac.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
the month of May,&rdquo; she further explained, indicating with a gesture
of her dimpled hand the roses abloom all around them.&nbsp; For the
Marquis had found her in a chair beneath the mulberry-tree in the old
garden of that house near Gemosac which looks across the river toward
the sea.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the month of May.&nbsp; One is young.&nbsp;
Such things have happened since the world began.&nbsp; They will happen
until it ends, Marquis.&nbsp; It happened in our own time, if I remember
correctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Madame de Chantonnay heaved a prodigious sigh, in memory of the
days that were no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given a young man of enterprise and not bad looking, I allow.&nbsp;
He has the grand air and his face is not without distinction.&nbsp;
Given a young girl, fresh as a flower, young, innocent, not without
feeling.&nbsp; Ah! I know, for I was like that myself.&nbsp; Place them
in a garden, in the springtime.&nbsp; What will they talk of&mdash;politics?&nbsp;
Ah&mdash;bah!&nbsp; Let them have long evenings together while their
elders play chess or a hand at b&eacute;zique.&nbsp; What game will
they play?&nbsp; A much older game than chess or b&eacute;zique, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the circumstances were so exceptional,&rdquo; protested
the Marquis, who had a pleased air, as if his anger were not without
an antidote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circumstances may be exceptional, my friend, but Love is a
Rule.&nbsp; You allow him to stay six weeks in the ch&acirc;teau, seeing
Juliette daily, and then you are surprised that one fine morning Monsieur
de Bourbon comes to you and tells you brusquely, as you report it, that
he wants to marry your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted the Marquis.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was what
you may describe as brusque.&nbsp; It is the English way, perhaps, of
treating such matters.&nbsp; Now, for myself I should have been warmer,
I think.&nbsp; I should have allowed myself a little play, as it were.&nbsp;
One says a few pretty things&mdash;is it not so?&nbsp; One suggests
that the lady is an angel and oneself entirely unworthy of a happiness
which is only to be compared with the happiness that is promised to
us in the hereafter.&nbsp; It is an occasion upon which to be eloquent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the English,&rdquo; corrected Madame de Chantonnay,
holding up a hand to emphasise her opinion.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you must
remember, that although our friend is French, he has been brought up
in that cold country&mdash;by a minister of their frozen religion, I
understand.&nbsp; I, who speak to you, know what they are, for once
I had an Englishman in love with me.&nbsp; It was in Paris, when Louis
XVIII. was King.&nbsp; And did this Englishman tell me that he was heart-broken,
I ask you?&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; On the contrary, he appeared to be of
an indifference only to be compared with the indifference of a tree.&nbsp;
He seemed to avoid me rather than seek my society.&nbsp; Once, he made
believe to forget that he had been presented to me.&nbsp; A ruse&mdash;a
mere ruse to conceal his passion.&nbsp; But I knew, I knew always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the poor man&rsquo;s fate?&nbsp; What was his
name, Comtesse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forget, my friend.&nbsp; For the moment I have forgotten
it.&nbsp; But tell me more about Monsieur de Bourbon and Juliette.&nbsp;
He is passionately in love with her, of course; he is so miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis reflected for a few moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;he may be so; he may
be so, Comtesse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;what did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis looked carefully round before replying.&nbsp; Then he
leant forward with his forefinger raised delicately to the tip of his
nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I temporised, Comtesse,&rdquo; he said, in a low voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I explained as gracefully as one could that it was too early
to think of such a development&mdash;that I was taken by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which could hardly have been true,&rdquo; put in Madame de
Chantonnay in an audible aside to the mulberry-tree, &ldquo;for neither
Guienne nor la Vend&eacute;e will be taken by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, in other words&mdash;a good many words, the more the
better, for one must be polite&mdash;&rsquo;Secure your throne, Monsieur,
and you shall marry Juliette.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it is not a position
into which one hurries the last of the house of Gemosac&mdash;to be
the wife of an unsuccessful claimant, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame de Chantonnay approved in one gesture of her stout hand of
these principles and of the Marquis de Gemosac&rsquo;s masterly demonstration
of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Monsieur de Bourbon&mdash;did he accept these conditions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed to, Madame.&nbsp; He seemed content to do so,&rdquo;
replied the Marquis, tapping his snuff-box and avoiding the lady&rsquo;s
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Juliette?&rdquo; inquired Madame, with a sidelong glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Juliette is sensible,&rdquo; replied the fond father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My daughter is, I hope, sensible, Comtesse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give yourself no uneasiness, my old friend,&rdquo; said Madame
de Chantonnay, heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame sat back in her chair and fanned herself thoughtfully.&nbsp;
It was the fashion of that day to carry a fan and wield it with grace
and effect.&nbsp; To fan oneself did not mean that the heat was oppressive,
any more than the use of incorrect English signifies to-day ill-breeding
or a lack of education.&nbsp; Both are an indication of a laudable desire
to be unmistakably in the movement of one&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Over her fan Madame cast a sidelong glance at the Marquis, whom she,
like many of his friends, suspected of being much less simple and spontaneous
than he appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they are not formally affianced?&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>! no.&nbsp; I clearly indicated that there
were other things to be thought of at the present time.&nbsp; A very
arduous task lies before him, but he is equal to it, I am certain.&nbsp;
My conviction as to that grows as one knows him better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not prepared to allow the young people to force
you to take a leap in the dark,&rdquo; suggested Madame de Chantonnay.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And that poor Juliette must consume her soul in patience; but
she is sensible, as you justly say.&nbsp; Yes, my dear Marquis, she
is charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were thus engaged in facile talk when Albert de Chantonnay emerged
from the long window of his study, a room opening on to a moss-grown
terrace, where this plotter walked to and fro like another Richelieu
and brooded over nation-shaking schemes.</p>
<p>He carried a letter in his hand and wore an air of genuine perturbment.&nbsp;
But even in his agitation he looked carefully round before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said to the Marquis and his fond mother, who
watched him with complacency&mdash;&ldquo;here I have a letter from
Dormer Colville.&nbsp; It is necessarily couched in very cautious language.&nbsp;
He probably knows, as I know, that any letter addressed to me is liable
to be opened.&nbsp; I have reason to believe that some of my letters
have not only been opened, but that copies of them are actually in the
possession of that man&mdash;the head of that which is called the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and looked darkly into a neighbouring clump of rhododendrons,
as if Louis Napoleon were perhaps lurking there.&nbsp; But he was nevertheless
quite right in his suspicions, which were verified twenty years later,
along with much duplicity which none had suspected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I know what Colville
seeks to convey to us, and is now hurrying away from Paris to confirm
to us by word of mouth.&nbsp; The bank of John Turner in the Rue Lafayette
has failed, and with it goes all the fortune of Madame St. Pierre Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both his hearers exclaimed aloud, and Madame de Chantonnay showed
signs of a desire to swoon; but as no one took any notice, she changed
her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a ruse to gain time,&rdquo; explained Albert, brushing
the thin end of his moustache upward with a gesture of resolution.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just as the other was a ruse to gain time.&nbsp; It is at present
a race between two resolute parties.&nbsp; The party which is ready
first and declares itself will be the victor.&nbsp; For to-day our poor
France is in the gutter: she is in the hands of the canaille, and the
canaille will accept the first who places himself upon an elevation
and scatters gold.&nbsp; What care they&mdash;King or Emperor, Emperor
or King!&nbsp; It is the same to them so long as they have a change
of some sort and see, or think they see, gain to themselves to be snatched
from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From which it will be seen that Albert de Chantonnay knew his countrymen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested Madame de Chantonnay, who had a Frenchwoman&rsquo;s
inimitable quickness to grasp a situation&mdash;&ldquo;but the Government
could scarcely cause a bank to fail&mdash;such an old-established bank
as Turner&rsquo;s, which has existed since the day of Louis XIV.&mdash;in
order to gain time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An unscrupulous Government can do anything in France,&rdquo;
replied the lady&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their existence depends upon
delay, and they are aware of it.&nbsp; They would ruin France rather
than forego their own aggrandisement.&nbsp; And this is part of their
scheme.&nbsp; They seek to delay us at all costs.&nbsp; To kidnap de
Bourbon was the first move.&nbsp; It failed.&nbsp; This is their second
move.&nbsp; What must be our countermove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clasped his hands behind his willowy back and paced slowly backward
and forward.&nbsp; By a gesture, Madame de Chantonnay bade the Marquis
keep silence while she drew his attention to the attitude of her son.&nbsp;
When he paused and fingered his whisker she gasped excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; said Albert, with an upward glance of inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Beauvoir estate,&rdquo; replied Albert, &ldquo;left to
me by my uncle.&nbsp; It is worth three hundred thousand francs.&nbsp;
That is enough for the moment.&nbsp; That must be our counter-move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame de Chantonnay protested volubly.&nbsp; For if Frenchmen are
ready to sacrifice, or, at all events, to risk all for a sentiment&mdash;and
history says nothing to the contrary&mdash;Frenchwomen are eminently
practical and far-sighted.</p>
<p>Madame had a hundred reasons why the Beauvoir estate should not be
sold.&nbsp; Many of them contradicted each other.&nbsp; She was not
what may be called a close reasoner, but she was roughly effective.&nbsp;
Many a general has won a victory not by the accuracy, but by the volume
of his fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will become of France,&rdquo; she cried to Albert&rsquo;s
retreating back as he walked to and fro, &ldquo;if none of the old families
has a son to bless itself with?&nbsp; And Heaven knows that there are
few enough remaining now.&nbsp; Besides, you will want to marry some
day, and what will your bride say when you have no money?&nbsp; There
are no <i>dots</i> growing in the hedgerows now.&nbsp; Not that I am
a stickler for a <i>dot</i>.&nbsp; Give me heart, I always say, and
keep the money yourself.&nbsp; And some day you will find a loving heart,
but no <i>dot</i>.&nbsp; And there is a tragedy at once&mdash;ready
made.&nbsp; Is it not so, my old friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to the Marquis de Gemosac for confirmation of this forecast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a danger, Madame,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is a danger which it would be well to foresee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had discussed a hundred times the possibility of a romantic
marriage between their two houses.&nbsp; Juliette and Albert&mdash;the
two last representatives of an old nobility long-famed in the annals
of the west&mdash;might well fall in love with each other.&nbsp; It
would be charming, Madame thought; but, alas! Albert would be wise to
look for a <i>dot</i>.</p>
<p>The Marquis paused.&nbsp; Again he temporised.&nbsp; For he could
not all in an instant decide which side of this question to take.&nbsp;
He looked at Albert, frail, romantic; an ideal representative of that
old nobility of France which was never practical, and elected to go
to the guillotine rather than seek to cultivate that modern virtue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time, Madame, it is well to remember that a loan
offered now may reasonably be expected to bring such a return in the
future as will provide <i>dots</i> for the de Chantonnays to the end
of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame was about to make a spirited reply; she might even have suggested
that the Beauvoir estate would be better apportioned to Albert&rsquo;s
wife than to Juliette as the wife of another, but Albert himself stopped
in front of them and swept away all argument by a passionate gesture
of his small, white hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is concluded,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sell the Beauvoir
estate!&nbsp; Have not the Chantonnays proved a hundred times that they
are equal to any sacrifice for the sake of France?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.&nbsp; A SQUARE MAN</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>All through the summer of 1851&mdash;a year to be marked for all
time in the minds of historians, not in red, but in black letters&mdash;the
war of politics tossed France hither and thither.</p>
<p>There were, at this time, five parties contending for mastery.&nbsp;
Should one of these appear for the moment to be about to make itself
secure in power, the other four would at once unite to tear the common
adversary from his unstable position.&nbsp; Of these parties, only two
were of real cohesion: the Legitimists and the Bonapartists.&nbsp; The
Socialists, the Moderate Republicans, and the Orleanists were too closely
allied in the past to be friendly in the present.&nbsp; Socialists are
noisy, but rarely clever.&nbsp; A man who in France describes himself
as Moderate must not expect to be popular for any length of time.&nbsp;
The Orleanists were only just out of office.&nbsp; It was scarcely a
year since Louis Philippe had died in exile at Claremont&mdash;only
three years since he signed his abdication and hurried across to Newhaven.&nbsp;
It was not the turn of the Orleanists.</p>
<p>There is no quarrel so deadly as a family quarrel; no fall so sudden
as that of a house divided against itself.&nbsp; All through the spring
and summer of 1851 France exhibited herself in the eyes of the world
a laughing-stock to her enemies, a thing of pity to those who loved
that great country.</p>
<p>The Republic of 1848 was already a house divided against itself.</p>
<p>Its President, Louis Bonaparte, had been elected for four years.&nbsp;
He was, as the law then stood, not eligible again until after the lapse
of another four years.&nbsp; His party tried to abrogate this law, and
failed.&nbsp; &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we shall elect
him again, and President he shall be, despite the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was only one of a hundred such clouds, no bigger than a man&rsquo;s
hand, arising at this time on the political horizon.&nbsp; For France
was beginning to wander down that primrose path where a law is only
a law so long as it is convenient.</p>
<p>There was one man, Louis Bonaparte, who kept his head when others
lost that invaluable adjunct; who pushed on doggedly to a set purpose;
whose task was hard even in France, and would have been impossible in
any other country.&nbsp; For it is only in France that ridicule does
not kill.&nbsp; And twice within the last fifteen years&mdash;once at
Strasbourg, once at Boulogne&mdash;he had made the world hold its sides
at the mention of his name, greeting with the laughter which is imbittered
by scorn, a failure damned by ridicule.</p>
<p>It has been said that Louis Bonaparte never gave serious thought
to the Legitimist party.&nbsp; He had inherited, it would seem, that
invaluable knowledge of men by which his uncle had risen to the greatest
throne of modern times.&nbsp; He knew that a party is never for a moment
equal to a Man.&nbsp; And the Legitimists had no man.&nbsp; They had
only the Comte de Chambord.</p>
<p>At Frohsdorff they still clung to their hopes, with that old-world
belief in the ultimate revival of a dead regime which was eminently
characteristic.&nbsp; And at Frohsdorff there died, in the October of
this year, the Duchess of Angoul&ecirc;me, Marie Therese Charlotte,
daughter of Marie Antoinette, who had despised her two uncles, Louis
XVIII. and Charles X., for the concessions they had made&mdash;who was
more Royalist than the King.&nbsp; She was the last of her generation,
the last of her family, and with her died a part of the greatness of
France, almost all the dignity of royalty, and the last master-mind
of the Bourbon race.</p>
<p>If, as Albert de Chantonnay stated, the failure of Turner&rsquo;s
bank was nothing but a ruse to gain time, it had the desired effect.&nbsp;
For a space, nothing could be undertaken, and the Marquis de Gemosac
and his friends were hindered from continuing the work they had so successfully
begun.</p>
<p>All through the summer Loo Barebone remained in France, at Gemosac
as much as anywhere.&nbsp; The Marquis de Gemosac himself went to Frohsdorff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she had been ten years younger,&rdquo; he said, on his
return, &ldquo;I could have persuaded her to receive you.&nbsp; She
has money.&nbsp; All the influence is hers.&nbsp; It is she who has
had the last word in all our affairs since the death of the Duc de Berri.&nbsp;
But she is old&mdash;she is broken.&nbsp; I think she is dying, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the time of the vintage again.&nbsp; Barebone remembered the
last vintage, and his journey through those provinces that supply all
the world with wine, with Dormer Colville for a companion.&nbsp; Since
then he had journeyed alone.&nbsp; He had made a hundred new friends,
had been welcomed in a hundred historic houses.&nbsp; Wherever he had
passed, he had left enthusiasm behind him&mdash;and he knew it.</p>
<p>He had grown accustomed to his own power, and yet its renewed evidence
was a surprise to him every day.&nbsp; There was something unreal in
it.&nbsp; There is always something unreal in fame, and great men know
in their own hearts<br />that they are not great.&nbsp; It is only the
world that thinks them so.&nbsp; When they are alone&mdash;in a room
by themselves&mdash;they feel for a moment their own smallness.&nbsp;
But the door opens, and in an instant they arise and play their part
mechanically.</p>
<p>This had come to be Barebone&rsquo;s daily task.&nbsp; It was so
easy to make his way in this world, which threw its doors open to him,
greeted him with outstretched hands, and only asked him to charm them
by being himself.&nbsp; He had not even to make an effort to appear
to be that which he was not.&nbsp; He had only to be himself, and they
were satisfied.</p>
<p>Part of his r&ocirc;le was Juliette de Gemosac.&nbsp; He found it
quite easy to make love to her; and she, it seemed, desired nothing
better.&nbsp; Nothing definite had been said by the Marquis de Gemosac.&nbsp;
They were not formally affianced.&nbsp; They were not forbidden to see
each other.&nbsp; But the irregularity of these proceedings lent a certain
spice of surreptitiousness to their intercourse which was not without
its charm.&nbsp; They did not see so much of each other after Loo had
spoken to the Marquis de Gemosac on this subject; for Barebone had to
make visits to other parts of France.&nbsp; Once or twice Juliette herself
went to stay with relatives.&nbsp; During these absences they did not
write to each other.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, impossible for Barebone to keep up any correspondence
whatever.&nbsp; He heard that Dormer Colville was still in Paris, seeking
to snatch something from the wreck of Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence&rsquo;s
fortune.&nbsp; The Marquis de Gemosac had been told that affairs might
yet be arranged.&nbsp; He was no financier, however, he admitted; he
did not understand such matters, and all that he knew was that the promised
help from the Englishwoman was not forthcoming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;a question of looking elsewhere.&nbsp;
It is not only that we want money.&nbsp; It is that we must have it
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not, strictly speaking, Loo&rsquo;s part to think of or to
administer the money.&nbsp; His was the part to be played by Kings&mdash;so
easy, if the gift is there, so impossible to acquire if it be lacking&mdash;to
know many people and to charm them all.&nbsp; Thus the summer ripened
into autumn.&nbsp; It had been another great vintage in the south, and
Bordeaux was more than usually busy when Barebone arrived there, at
daybreak, one morning in November, having posted from Toulouse.&nbsp;
He was more daring in winter, and went fearlessly through the streets.&nbsp;
In cold weather it is so much easier for a man to conceal his identity;
for a woman to hide her beauty, if she wish to&mdash;which is a large
If.&nbsp; Barebone could wear a fur collar and turn it up round that
tell-tale chin, which made the passer-by pause and turn to look at him
again if it was visible.</p>
<p>He breakfasted at the old-fashioned inn in the heart of the town,
where to this day the diligences deposit their passengers, and then
he made his way to the quay, from whence he would take passage down
the river.&nbsp; It was a cold morning, and there are few colder cities,
south of Paris, than Bordeaux.&nbsp; Barebone hurried, his breath frozen
on the fur of his collar.&nbsp; Suddenly he stopped.&nbsp; His new self&mdash;that
phantom second-nature bred of custom&mdash;vanished in the twinkling
of an eye, and left him plain Loo Barebone, of Farlingford, staring
across the green water toward &ldquo;The Last Hope,&rdquo; deep-laden,
anchored in mid-stream.</p>
<p>Seeing him stop, a boatman ran toward him from a neighbouring flight
of steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An English ship, monsieur,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;just come
in.&nbsp; Her anchors are hardly home.&nbsp; Does monsieur wish to go
on board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, comrade&mdash;as quick as you like,&rdquo;
he answered, with a gay laugh.&nbsp; It was odd that the sight of this
structure, made of human hands, should change him in a flash of thought,
should make his heart leap in his breast.</p>
<p>In a few minutes he was seated in the wherry, half way out across
the stream.&nbsp; Already a face was looking over the bulwarks.&nbsp;
The hands were on the forecastle, still busy clearing decks after the
confusion of letting go anchor and hauling in the jib-boom.</p>
<p>Barebone could see them leave off work and turn to look at him.&nbsp;
One or two raised a hand in salutation and then turned again to their
task.&nbsp; Already the mate&mdash;a Farlingford man, who had succeeded
Loo&mdash;was standing on the rail fingering a coil of rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old man is down below,&rdquo; he said, giving Barebone a hand.&nbsp;
From the forecastle came sundry grunts, and half a dozen heads were
jerked sideways at him.</p>
<p>Captain Clubbe was in the cabin, where the remains of breakfast had
been pushed to one end of the table to make room for pens and ink.&nbsp;
The Captain was laboriously filling in the countless documents required
by the French custom-house.&nbsp; He looked up, pen in hand, and all
the wrinkles, graven by years of hardship and trouble, were swept away
like writing from a slate.</p>
<p>He laid aside his pen and held his hand out across the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had your breakfast?&rdquo; he asked, curtly, with a glance
at the empty coffee-pot.</p>
<p>Loo laughed as he sat down.&nbsp; It was all so familiar&mdash;the
disorder of the cabin; the smell of lamp-oil; the low song of the wind
through the rigging, that came humming in at the doorway, which was
never closed, night or day, unless the seas were washing to and fro
on the main deck.&nbsp; He knew everything so well; the very pen and
the rarely used ink-pot; the Captain&rsquo;s attitude, and the British
care that he took not to speak with his lips that which was in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Captain Clubbe, taking up his pen again,
&ldquo;how are you getting on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the business that brought you to this country,&rdquo;
answered Clubbe, with a sudden gruffness; for he was, like the majority
of big men, shy.</p>
<p>Barebone looked at him across the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what the business is that brought me to this country?&rdquo;
he asked.&nbsp; And Captain Clubbe looked thoughtfully at the point
of his pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the Marquis de Gemosac and Dormer Colville tell you everything,
or only a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose they told me everything,&rdquo; was
the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should they?&nbsp; I am only a seafaring
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they told you enough,&rdquo; persisted Barebone, &ldquo;for
you to draw your own conclusions as to my business over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Clubbe, with a glance across the table.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is it going badly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is going splendidly,&rdquo;
answered Barebone, gaily; and Captain Clubbe ducked his head down again
over the papers of the French custom-house.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is going
splendidly, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused.&nbsp; Half an hour ago he had no thought in his mind of
Captain Clubbe or of Farlingford.&nbsp; He had come on board merely
to greet his old friends, to hear some news of home, to take up for
a moment that old self of bygone days and drop it again.&nbsp; And now,
in half a dozen questions and answers, whither was he drifting?&nbsp;
Captain Clubbe filled in a word, slowly and very legibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not the man, you know,&rdquo; said Barebone, slowly.&nbsp;
It was as if the sight of that just man had bidden him cry out the truth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am not the man they think me.&nbsp; My father was not the son
of Louis XVI., I know that now.&nbsp; I did not know it at first, but
I know it now.&nbsp; And I have been going on with the thing, all the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clubbe sat back in his chair.&nbsp; He was large and ponderous in
body.&nbsp; And the habit of the body at length becomes the nature of
the mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has been telling you that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dormer Colville.&nbsp; He told me one thing first and then
the other.&nbsp; Only he and you and I know of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he must have told one lie,&rdquo; said Clubbe, reflectively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One that we know of.&nbsp; And what he says is of no value either
way; for he doesn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; No one knows.&nbsp; Your father
was a friend of mine, man and boy, and he didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He
was not the same as other men; I know that&mdash;but nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if you were me, you would give yourself the benefit
of the doubt?&rdquo; asked Barebone, with a rather reckless laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For the sake of others&mdash;for the sake of France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Clubbe, bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is practically impossible to go back now,&rdquo; explained
Loo.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be the ruin of all my friends, the downfall
of France.&nbsp; In my position, what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your position,&rdquo; replied Clubbe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand politics; I am only a seafaring man.&nbsp;
But there is only one thing to do&mdash;the square thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested Dormer Colville&rsquo;s pupil, &ldquo;I
cannot throw over my friends.&nbsp; I cannot abandon France now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The square thing,&rdquo; repeated the sailor, stubbornly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The square thing; and damn your friends&mdash;damn France!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose as he spoke, for they had both heard the customs officers
come on board; and these functionaries were now bowing at the cabin-door.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.&nbsp; MRS. ST. PIERRE LAWRENCE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>It was early in November that the report took wing in Paris that
John Turner&rsquo;s bank was, after all, going to weather the storm.&nbsp;
Dormer Colville was among the first to hear this news, and strangely
enough he did not at once impart it to Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence.</p>
<p>All through the year, John Turner had kept his client supplied with
ready money.&nbsp; He had, moreover, made no change in his own mode
of living.&nbsp; Which things are a mystery to all who have no money
of their own nor the good fortune to handle other people&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
There is no doubt some explanation of the fact that bankers and other
financiers seem to fail, and even become bankrupt, without tangible
effect upon their daily comfort, but the unfinancial cannot expect to
understand it.</p>
<p>There had, as a matter of fact, been no question of discomfort for
Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I spend as much as I like?&rdquo; she had asked Turner,
and his reply had been in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use in saving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; To which Mrs. St.
Pierre Lawrence made answer that she did not understand things at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no use collecting straws against a flood,&rdquo; the
banker answered, sleepily.</p>
<p>There was, of course, no question now of supplying the necessary
funds to the Marquis de Gemosac and Albert de Chantonnay, who, it was
understood, were raising the money, not without difficulty, elsewhere.&nbsp;
Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence had indeed heard little or nothing of her Royalist
friends in the west.&nbsp; Human nature is the same, it would appear,
all the world over, but the upper crust is always the hardest.</p>
<p>When Colville was informed of the rumour, he remembered that he had
never quarrelled with John Turner.&nbsp; He had, of course, said some
hard things in the heat of the moment, but Turner had not retorted.&nbsp;
There was no quarrel.&nbsp; Colville, therefore, took an early opportunity
of lunching at the club then reputed to have the best chef in Paris.&nbsp;
He went late and found that the majority of members had finished d&eacute;jeuner
and were taking coffee in one or other of the smoking-rooms.</p>
<p>After a quick and simple meal, Colville lighted a cigarette and went
upstairs.&nbsp; There were two or three small rooms where members smoked
or played cards or read the newspapers, and in the quietest of these
John Turner was alone, asleep.&nbsp; Colville walked backward into the
room, talking loudly as he did so with a friend in the passage.&nbsp;
When well over the threshold he turned: John Turner, whose slumbers
had been rudely disturbed, was sitting up rubbing his eyes.&nbsp; The
surprise was of course mutual, and for a moment there was an awkward
pause; then, with a smile of frank good-fellowship, Colville advanced,
holding out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we have known each other too many years, old fellow,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;to bear any lasting ill-will for words spoken in the
heat of anger or disappointment, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood in front of the banker frankly holding out the hand of forgiveness,
his head a little on one side, that melancholy smile of toleration for
poor human weakness in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; admitted Turner, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve certainly
known each other a good many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He somewhat laboriously hoisted himself up, his head emerging from
his tumbled collar like the head of a tortoise aroused from sleep, and
gave into Colville&rsquo;s affectionate grasp a limp and nerveless hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one could feel for you more sincerely than I do,&rdquo;
Colville assured him, drawing forward a chair,&mdash;&ldquo;more than
I have done all through these trying months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very kind, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; murmured Turner, looking
drowsily at his friend&rsquo;s necktie.&nbsp; One must look somewhere,
and Turner always gazed at the necktie of any one who sat straight in
front of him, which usually induced an uneasy fingering of that ornament
and an early consultation of the nearest mirror.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have a
cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the faint suggestion of a twinkle beneath the banker&rsquo;s
heavy lids as Colville accepted this peace-offering.&nbsp; It was barely
twenty-four hours since he had himself launched in Colville&rsquo;s
direction the rumour which had brought about this reconciliation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; continued the other, turning to
cut the end of the cigar, &ldquo;that no one would be better pleased
to hear that better times are coming&mdash;eh?&nbsp; What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t speak,&rdquo; was the reply to
this vague interrogation.&nbsp; Then they talked of other things.&nbsp;
There was no lack of topics for conversation at this time in France;
indeed, the whole country was in a buzz of talk.&nbsp; But Turner was
not, it seemed, in a talkative mood.&nbsp; Only once did he rouse himself
to take more than a passing interest in the subject touched upon by
his easy-going companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;he may be the best cook in
Paris, but he is not what he was.&nbsp; It is this Revision of the Constitution
which is upsetting the whole country, especially the lower classes.&nbsp;
The man&rsquo;s hand is shaky.&nbsp; I can see it from his way of pouring
the mayonnaise over a salad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After touching upon each fresh topic, Colville seemed to return unconsciously
to that which must of necessity be foremost in his companion&rsquo;s
thoughts&mdash;the possibility of saving Turner&rsquo;s bank from failure.&nbsp;
And each time he learnt a little more.&nbsp; At last, with that sympathetic
spontaneity which was his chief charm, Dormer Colville laid his hand
confidentially on Turner&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are you going
to pull it through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, old fellow, I am,&rdquo; was the reply, which made
Colville glance hastily at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;look at the time.&nbsp; You
have kept me gossiping the whole afternoon.&nbsp; Must be off.&nbsp;
Nobody will be better pleased than I am to hear the good news.&nbsp;
But of course I am mum.&nbsp; Not a word will they hear from me.&nbsp;
I <i>am</i> glad.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are,&rdquo; murmured Turner to the closed door.</p>
<p>Dormer Colville was that which is known as an opportunist.&nbsp;
It was a dull grey afternoon.&nbsp; He would be sure to find Mrs. St.
Pierre Lawrence at home.&nbsp; She had taken an apartment in the Rue
de Lille in the St. Germain quarter.&nbsp; His way was past the flower-shop,
where he sometimes bestowed a fickle custom.&nbsp; He went in and bought
a carnation for his buttonhole.</p>
<p>It is to be presumed that John Turner devoted the afternoon to his
affairs.&nbsp; It was at all events evening before he also bent his
steps toward the Rue de Lille.</p>
<p>Yes, the servant told him, Madame was at home and would assuredly
see him.&nbsp; Madame was not alone.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It was, however,
only Monsieur Colville, who was so frequent a visitor.</p>
<p>Turner followed the servant along the corridor.&nbsp; The stairs
had rather tried one who had to elevate such a weight at each step;
he breathed hard, but placidly.</p>
<p>Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence received him with an unusual <i>empressement</i>.&nbsp;
Dormer Colville, who was discovered sitting as far from her as the size
of the room allowed, was less eager, but he brought forward a chair
for the banker and glanced sharply at his face as he sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So glad to see you,&rdquo; the hostess explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is really kind of you to come and cheer one up on such a dull afternoon.&nbsp;
Dormer and I&mdash;won&rsquo;t you take off your coat?&nbsp; No, let
<i>me</i> put it aside for you.&nbsp; Dormer and I were just&mdash;just
saying how dull it was.&nbsp; Weren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked from one to the other with a rather unnatural laugh.&nbsp;
One would have thought that she was engaged in carrying off a difficult
situation and, for so practised a woman of the world, not doing it very
well.&nbsp; Her cheeks were flushed, which made her look younger, and
a subtle uncertainty in her voice and manner added to this illusion
charmingly.&nbsp; For a young girl&rsquo;s most precious possession
is her inexperience.&nbsp; Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, for the first time
in her life, was not sure of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I hope you have not come on business,&rdquo; she added,
drawing forward her own chair and passing a quick hand over her hair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bother business!&nbsp; Do not let us think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; replied Turner, recovering his breath.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Quite agree with you.&nbsp; Let us say, &lsquo;Bother business,&rsquo;
and not think of it.&nbsp; Though, for an old man who is getting stout,
there is nothing much left but business and his dinner, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Do not say that,&rdquo; cried the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never
say that.&nbsp; It is time enough to think that years hence when we
are all white-haired.&nbsp; But I used to think that myself once, you
know.&nbsp; When I first had my money.&nbsp; Do you remember?&nbsp;
I was so pleased to have all that wealth that I determined to learn
all about cheque-books and things and manage it myself.&nbsp; So you
taught me, and at last you admitted that I was an excellent man of business.&nbsp;
I know I thought I was myself.&nbsp; And I suppose I lapsed into a regular
business woman and only thought of money and how to increase it.&nbsp;
How horrid you must have thought me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never did that,&rdquo; protested Turner, stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know I learnt to think much too much about it,&rdquo;
Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence went on eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now that
it is all gone, I do not care <i>that</i> for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She snapped her finger and thumb and laughed gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; She turned and glanced
at Dormer Colville, raising her eyebrows in some mute interrogation
only comprehensible to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I tell him?&rdquo; she
asked, with a laugh of happiness not very far removed from tears.&nbsp;
Then she turned to the banker again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am going to tell you
something which no one else in the world can tell you.&nbsp; Dormer
and I are going to be married.&nbsp; I dare say lots of people will
say that they have expected it for a long time.&nbsp; They can say what
they like.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; And I am glad that you are
the first person to hear it.&nbsp; We have only just settled it, so
you are the very first to be told.&nbsp; And I am glad to tell you before
anybody else because you have been so kind to me always.&nbsp; You have
been my best friend, I think.&nbsp; And the kindest thing you ever did
for me was to lose my money, for if you had not lost it, Dormer never
would have asked me to marry him.&nbsp; He has just said so himself.&nbsp;
And I suppose all men feel that.&nbsp; All the nice ones, I mean.&nbsp;
It is one of the drawbacks of being rich, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is,&rdquo; answered Turner, stolidly, without
turning an eyelash in the direction of Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps
that is why no one has ever asked me to marry them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence laughed jerkily at this witticism.&nbsp;
She laughed again when John Turner rose from his chair to congratulate
her, but the laugh suddenly ceased when he raised her hand to his lips
with a courtesy which was even in those days dying out of the world,
and turned away from him hastily.&nbsp; She stood with her back toward
them for a minute or two looking at some flowers on a side table.&nbsp;
Then she came back into the middle of the room, all smiles, replacing
her handkerchief in her pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that is the news I have to tell you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>John Turner had placidly resumed his chair after shaking hands with
Dormer Colville for the second time since luncheon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it is news indeed.&nbsp; And
I have a little news to give you.&nbsp; I do not say that it is quite
free from the taint of business, but at all events it is news.&nbsp;
Like yours, it has the merit of being at first hand, and you are the
first to hear it.&nbsp; No one else could tell it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off and rubbed his chin while he looked apathetically at
Colville&rsquo;s necktie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has another merit, rare enough,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is good news.&nbsp; I think, in fact I may say I am sure,
that we shall pull through now and your money will be safely returned
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; said Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, with a
glance at Dormer Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot tell you how glad I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at the banker with bright eyes and the flush still in
her cheeks that made her look younger and less sure of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only for my own sake, you know.&nbsp; For yours, because
I am sure you must be relieved, and for&mdash;well, for everybody&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; Tell me all about it, please.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she pushed
her chair sideways nearer to Colville&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>John Turner bit the first joint of his thumb reflectively.&nbsp;
It is so rare that one can tell any one all about anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me first,&rdquo; Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence suggested,
&ldquo;whether Miriam Liston&rsquo;s money is all safe as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miriam&rsquo;s money never was in danger,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Miriam is my ward; you are only my client.&nbsp; There is no
chance of Miriam being able to make ducks and drakes of her money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds as if I had been trying to do that with mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; admitted the banker, with a placid laugh, &ldquo;if
it had not been for my failure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call it hard names,&rdquo; put in Dormer Colville,
generously.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was not a failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it a temporary suspension of payment, then,&rdquo; agreed
the banker, imperturbably.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it had not been for that,
half your fortune would have been goodness knows where by now.&nbsp;
You wanted to put it into some big speculation in this country, if I
remember aright.&nbsp; And big speculations in France are the very devil
just now.&nbsp; Whereas, now, you see, it is all safe and you can invest
it in the beginning of next year in some good English securities.&nbsp;
It seems providential, does it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose as he spoke and held out his hand to say goodbye.&nbsp; He
asked the question of Colville&rsquo;s necktie, apparently, for he smiled
stupidly at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do not understand business after all, I admit that,&rdquo;
Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence called out gaily to him as he went toward the
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not understand things at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t suppose you ever will,&rdquo; Turner
replied as he followed the servant into the corridor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.&nbsp; AN UNDERSTANDING</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Loo Barebone went back to the Ch&acirc;teau de Gemosac after those
travels in Provence which terminated so oddly on board &ldquo;The Last
Hope,&rdquo; at anchor in the Garonne River.</p>
<p>The Marquis received him with enthusiasm and a spirit of optimism
which age could not dim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is going <i>&agrave; merveille</i>!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In three months we shall be ready to strike our blow&mdash;to
make our great <i>coup</i> for France.&nbsp; The failure of Turner&rsquo;s
bank was a severe check, I admit, and for a moment I was in despair.&nbsp;
But now we are sure that we shall have the money for Albert de Chantonnay&rsquo;s
Beauvoir estate by the middle of January.&nbsp; The death of Madame
la Duchesse was a misfortune.&nbsp; If we could have persuaded her to
receive you&mdash;your face would have done the rest, <i>mon ami</i>&mdash;we
should have been invincible.&nbsp; But she was broken, that poor lady.&nbsp;
Think of her life!&nbsp; Few women would have survived half of the troubles
that she carried on those proud shoulders from childhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were sitting in the little salon in the building that adjoined
the gate-house of Gemosac, of which the stone stairs must have rung
beneath the red spurs of fighting men; of which the walls were dented
still with the mark of arms.</p>
<p>Barebone had given an account of his journey, which had been carried
through without difficulty.&nbsp; Everywhere success had waited upon
him&mdash;enthusiasm had marked his passage.&nbsp; In returning to France,
he had stolen a march on his enemies, for nothing seemed to indicate
that his presence in the country was known to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; the Marquis explained, &ldquo;that he has
his hands full&mdash;that man in Paris.&nbsp; It is only a month since
he changed his ministry.&nbsp; Who is this St. Arnaud, his Minister
of War?&nbsp; Who is Maupas, his Prefect of Police?&nbsp; Does Monsieur
Maupas know that we are nearly ready for our <i>coup</i>?&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp;
Tell me nothing of that sort, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was the universally accepted opinion at this time, of Louis
Bonaparte the President of a tottering Republic, divided against itself;
a dull man, at his wits&rsquo; end.&nbsp; For months, all Europe had
been turning an inquiring and watchful eye on France.&nbsp; Socialism
was rampant.&nbsp; Secret societies honeycombed the community.&nbsp;
There was some danger in the air&mdash;men knew not what.&nbsp; Catastrophe
was imminent, and none knew where to look for its approach.&nbsp; But
all thought that it must come at the end of the year.&nbsp; A sort of
panic took hold of all classes.&nbsp; They dreaded the end of 1851.</p>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac spoke openly of these things before Juliette.&nbsp;
She had been present when Loo and he talked together of this last journey,
so happily accomplished, so fruitful of result.&nbsp; And Loo did not
tell the Marquis that he had seen his old ship, &ldquo;The Last Hope,&rdquo;
in the river at Bordeaux, and had gone on board of her.</p>
<p>Juliette listened, as she worked, beneath the lamp at the table in
the middle of the room.&nbsp; The lace-work she had brought from the
convent-school was not finished yet.&nbsp; It was exquisitely fine and
delicate, and Juliette executed the most difficult patterns with a sort
of careless ease.&nbsp; Sometimes, when the Marquis was more than usually
extravagant in his anticipations of success, or showed a superlative
contempt for his foes, Juliette glanced at Barebone over her lace-work,
but she rarely took part in the talk when politics were under discussion.</p>
<p>In domestic matters, however, this new ch&acirc;telaine showed considerable
shrewdness.&nbsp; She was not ignorant of the price of hay, and knew
to a cask how much wine was stored in the vault beneath the old chapel.&nbsp;
On these subjects the Marquis good-humouredly followed her advice sometimes.&nbsp;
His word had always been law in the whole neighbourhood.&nbsp; Was he
not the head of one of the oldest families in France?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>pardieu</i>, she shows a wisdom quite phenomenal,
that little one,&rdquo; the Marquis would tell his friends, with a hearty
laugh.&nbsp; It was only natural that he should consider amusing the
idea of uniting wisdom and youth and beauty in one person.&nbsp; It
is still a universally accepted law that old people must be wise and
young persons only charming.&nbsp; Some may think that they could point
to a wise child born of foolish parents; to a daughter who is well-educated
and shrewd, possessing a sense of logic, and a mother who is ignorant
and foolish; to a son who has more sense than his father: but of course
such observers must be mistaken.&nbsp; Old theories must be the right
ones.&nbsp; The Marquis had no doubt of this, at all events, and thought
it most amusing that Juliette should establish order in the chaos of
domestic affairs at Gemosac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are grave,&rdquo; said Juliette to Barebone, one evening
soon after his return, when they happened to be alone in the little
drawing-room.&nbsp; Barebone was, in fact, not a lively companion; for
he had sat staring at the log-fire for quite three minutes when his
eyes might assuredly have been better employed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
grave.&nbsp; Are you thinking of your sins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I think of those, Mademoiselle, I laugh.&nbsp; It is
when I think of you that I am grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am always grave, you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced quickly, not at him but toward him, and then continued
her lace-making, with the ghost of a smile tilting the corners of her
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because I have something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret?&rdquo; she inquired, and she continued to smile,
but differently, and her eyes hardened almost to resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a secret.&nbsp; It is a secret only known to two other
people in the world besides myself.&nbsp; And they will never let you
know even that they share it with you, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they are not women,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell it to me, then&mdash;your secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been an odd suggestion of foreknowledge in her manner,
as if she were humouring him by pretending to accept as a secret of
vast importance some news which she had long known&mdash;that little
air of patronage which even schoolgirls bestow, at times, upon white-haired
men.&nbsp; It is part of the maternal instinct.&nbsp; But this vanished
when she heard that she was to share the secret with two men, and she
repeated, impatiently, &ldquo;Tell me, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a secret which will make a difference to us all our
lives, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, warningly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will
not leave us the same as it found us.&nbsp; It has made a difference
to all who know it.&nbsp; Therefore, I have only decided to tell you
after long consideration.&nbsp; It is, in fact, a point of honour.&nbsp;
It is necessary for you to know, whatever the result may be.&nbsp; Of
that I have no doubt whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed reassuringly, which made her glance at him gravely, almost
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you going on telling it to other people, afterward,&rdquo;
she inquired; &ldquo;to my father, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mademoiselle.&nbsp; It comes to you, and it stops at you.&nbsp;
I do not mind withholding it from your father, and from all the friends
who have been so kind to me in France.&nbsp; I do not mind deceiving
kings and emperors, Mademoiselle, and even the People, which is now
always spelt in capital letters, and must be spoken of with bated breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a scornful little laugh, as at the sound of an old jest&mdash;the
note of a deathless disdain which was in the air she breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even the newspapers, which are trying to govern France.&nbsp;
All that is a question of politics.&nbsp; But when it comes to you,
Mademoiselle, that is a different matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; It is then a question of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juliette slowly changed colour, but she gave a little gay laugh of
incredulity and bent her head away from the light of the lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a different code of honour altogether,&rdquo; he said,
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;A code one does not wish to tamper with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; she inquired, with the odd little smile of foreknowledge
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; And, therefore, before I go any farther, I think
it best to tell you that I am not what I am pretending to be.&nbsp;
I am pretending to be the son of the little Dauphin, who escaped from
the Temple.&nbsp; He may have escaped from the Temple; that I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; But I know, or at least I think I know, that he is not buried
in Farlingford churchyard and he was not my father.&nbsp; I can pass
as the grandson of Louis XVI.; I know that.&nbsp; I can deceive all
the world.&nbsp; I can even climb to the throne of France, perhaps.&nbsp;
There are many, as you know, who think I shall do it without difficulty.&nbsp;
But I do not propose to deceive <i>you</i>, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a short silence, while Loo watched her face.&nbsp; Juliette
had not even changed colour.&nbsp; When she was satisfied that he had
nothing more to add, she looked at him, her needle poised in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it matters?&rdquo; she asked, in a little cool,
even voice.</p>
<p>It was so different from what he had expected that, for a moment,
he was taken aback.&nbsp; Captain Clubbe&rsquo;s bluff, uncompromising
reception of the same news had haunted his thoughts.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
square thing,&rdquo; that sailor had said, &ldquo;and damn your friends;
damn France.&rdquo;&nbsp; Loo looked at Juliette in doubt; then, suddenly,
he understood her point of view; he understood her.&nbsp; He had learnt
to understand a number of people and a number of points of view during
the last twelve months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as I succeed?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;So long as
you succeed, I do not see that it can matter who you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I succeed,&rdquo; pursued Loo, gravely, &ldquo;will
you marry me, Mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I never said that,&rdquo; in a voice that was ready to
yield to a really good argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I fail&mdash;&rdquo; Barebone paused for an instant.&nbsp;
He still doubted his own perception.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if I fail, you
would not marry me under any circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think my father would let me,&rdquo; she answered,
with her eyes cast down upon her lace-frame.</p>
<p>Barebone leant forward to put together the logs, which burnt with
a white incandescence that told of a frosty night.&nbsp; The Marquis
had business in the town, and would soon return from the notary&rsquo;s,
in time to dress for dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Loo, over his shoulder, &ldquo;it is as
well to understand each other, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, significantly.&nbsp; She ignored
the implied sarcasm altogether.&nbsp; There was so much meaning in her
reply that Loo turned to look at her.&nbsp; She was smiling as she worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;you have told me your secret&mdash;a
secret.&nbsp; But I have the other, too; the secret you have not told
me, <i>mon ami</i>.&nbsp; I have had it always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secret that you do not love me,&rdquo; said Juliette,
in her little wise, even voice; &ldquo;that you have never loved me.&nbsp;
Ah!&nbsp; You think we do not know.&nbsp; You think that I am too young.&nbsp;
But we are never too young to know that, to know all about it.&nbsp;
I think we know it in our cradles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with a strange philosophy, far beyond her years.&nbsp;
It might have been Madame de Chantonnay who spoke, with all that lady&rsquo;s
vast experience of life and without any of her folly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I am pretty.&nbsp; Perhaps I am.&nbsp; Just pretty
enough to enable you to pretend, and you have pretended very well at
times.&nbsp; You are good at pretending, one must conclude.&nbsp; Oh!
I bear no ill-will . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off and looked at him, with a gay laugh, in which there
was certainly no note of ill-will to be detected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is as well,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;as you say,
that we should understand each other.&nbsp; Thank you for telling me
your secret&mdash;the one you have told me.&nbsp; I am flattered at
that mark of your confidence.&nbsp; A woman is always glad to be told
a secret, and immediately begins to anticipate the pleasure she will
take in telling it to others, in confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up for a moment from her work; for Loo had given a short
laugh.&nbsp; She looked, to satisfy herself that it was not the ungenerous
laugh that nine men out of ten would have cast at her; and it was not.&nbsp;
For Loo was looking at her with frank amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I know that, too.&nbsp; It
is one of the items not included in a convent education.&nbsp; It is
unnecessary to teach us such things as that.&nbsp; We know them before
we go in.&nbsp; Your secret is safe enough with me, however&mdash;the
one you have told me.&nbsp; That is the least I can promise in return
for your confidence.&nbsp; As to the other secret, <i>bon Dieu</i>!
we will pretend I do not know it, if you like.&nbsp; At all events,
you can vow that you never told me, if&mdash;if ever you are called
upon to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for a moment to finish off a thread.&nbsp; Then, when
she reached out her hand for the reel, she glanced at him with a smile,
not unkind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you need not pretend any more, monsieur,&rdquo; she said,
seeing that Barebone was wise enough to keep silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
do not know who you are, <i>mon ami</i>,&rdquo; she went on, in a little
burst of confidence; &ldquo;and, as I told you just now, I do not care.&nbsp;
And, as to that other matter, there is no ill-will.&nbsp; I only permit
myself to wonder, sometimes, if she is pretty.&nbsp; That is feminine,
I suppose.&nbsp; One can be feminine quite young, you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with unfathomable eyes and a little smile, such
as men never forget once they have seen it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were inclined to be ironical just now, when I said
I would marry you if you were successful.&nbsp; So I mention that other
secret just to show that the understanding you wish to arrive at may
be mutual&mdash;there may be two sides to it.&nbsp; I hear my father
coming.&nbsp; That is his voice at the gate.&nbsp; We will leave things
as they stand: <i>n&rsquo;est ce pas</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose as she spoke and went toward the door.&nbsp; The Marquis&rsquo;s
voice was raised, and there seemed to be some unusual clamour at the
gate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.&nbsp; A COUP-D&rsquo;&Eacute;TAT</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>As the Marquis de Gemosac&rsquo;s step was already on the stairs,
Barebone was spared the necessity of agreeing in words to the inevitable.</p>
<p>A moment later the old man hurried into the room.&nbsp; He had not
even waited to remove his coat and gloves.&nbsp; A few snow-flakes powdered
his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, on perceiving Barebone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good&mdash;you
are safe!&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned to speak to some one who was following
him up the stairs with the slower steps of one who knew not his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is well!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is here.&nbsp;
Give yourself no anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the second comer crossed the threshold, coming suddenly out of
the shadow of the staircase.&nbsp; It was Dormer Colville, white with
snow, his face grey and worn.&nbsp; He shook hands with Barebone and
bowed to Juliette, but the Marquis gave him no time to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go down into the town,&rdquo; he explained, breathlessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The streets are full.&nbsp; There is a crowd on the market-place,
more especially round the tobacconist&rsquo;s, where the newspapers
are to be bought.&nbsp; No newspapers, if you please.&nbsp; The Paris
journals of last Sunday, and this is Friday evening.&nbsp; Nothing since
that.&nbsp; No Bordeaux journal.&nbsp; No news at all from Paris: absolute
silence from Toulouse and Limoges.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is another revolution,&rsquo;
they tell each other.&nbsp; Something has happened and no one knows
what.&nbsp; A man comes up to me and tugs at my sleeve.&nbsp; &lsquo;Inside
your walls, Monsieur le Marquis, waste no time,&rsquo; he whispers,
and is gone.&nbsp; He is some stable-boy.&nbsp; I have seen him somewhere.&nbsp;
I! inside my walls!&nbsp; Here in Gemosac, where I see nothing but bare
heads as I walk through the streets.&nbsp; Name of God! I should laugh
at such a precaution.&nbsp; And while I am still trying to gather information
the man comes back to me.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not the people you have
to fear,&rsquo; he whispers in my ear, &lsquo;it is the Government.&nbsp;
The order for your arrest is at the Gendarmerie, for it was I who took
it there.&nbsp; Monsieur Albert was arrested yesterday, and is now in
La Rochelle.&nbsp; Madame de Chantonnay&rsquo;s house is guarded.&nbsp;
It is from Madame I come.&rsquo;&nbsp; And again he goes.&nbsp; While
I am hesitating, I hear the step of a horse, tired and yet urged to
its utmost.&nbsp; It is Dormer Colville, this faithful friend, who is
from Paris in thirty-six hours to warn us.&nbsp; He shall tell his story
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not much to tell,&rdquo; said Colville, in a hollow
voice.&nbsp; He looked round for a chair and sat down rather abruptly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Louis Bonaparte is absolute master of France; that is all.&nbsp;
He must be so by this time.&nbsp; When I escaped from Paris yesterday
morning nearly all the streets were barricaded.&nbsp; But the troops
were pouring into the city as I rode out&mdash;and artillery.&nbsp;
I saw one barricade carried by artillery.&nbsp; Thousands must have
been killed in the streets of Paris yesterday &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;And, <i>bon Dieu</i>! it is called a <i>coup-d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>,&rdquo;
interrupted the Marquis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was on Tuesday,&rdquo; explained Colville, in his tired
voice&mdash;&ldquo;at six o&rsquo;clock on Tuesday morning.&nbsp; Yesterday
and Wednesday were days of massacre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my friend,&rdquo; exclaimed the Marquis, impatiently,
&ldquo;tell us how it happened.&nbsp; You laugh!&nbsp; It is no time
to laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Colville, with an odd smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think there is nothing else to be done&mdash;it is all so complete.&nbsp;
We are all so utterly fooled by this man whom all the world took to
be a dolt.&nbsp; On Tuesday morning he arrested seventy-eight of the
Representatives.&nbsp; When Paris awoke, the streets had been placarded
in the night with the decree of the President of the Republic.&nbsp;
The National Assembly was dissolved.&nbsp; The Council of State was
dissolved.&nbsp; Martial law was declared.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; He does
not even trouble to give a reason.&nbsp; He has the army at his back.&nbsp;
The soldiers cried <i>&lsquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur&rsquo;</i> as they
charged the crowd on Wednesday.&nbsp; He has got rid of his opponents
by putting them in prison.&nbsp; Many, it is said, are already on their
way to exile in Cayenne; the prisons are full.&nbsp; There is a warrant
out against myself; against you, Barebone; against you, of course, Monsieur
le Marquis.&nbsp; Albert de Chantonnay was arrested at Tours, and is
now in La Rochelle.&nbsp; We may escape&mdash;we may get away to-night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and looked hurriedly toward the door, for some one was
coming up the stairs&mdash;some one who wore sabots.&nbsp; It was the
servant, Marie, who came unceremoniously into the room with the exaggerated
calm of one who realises the gravity of the situation and means to master
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The town is on fire,&rdquo; she explained, curtly; &ldquo;they
have begun on the Gendarmerie.&nbsp; Doubtless they have heard that
these gentlemen are to be arrested, and it is to give other employment
to the gendarmes.&nbsp; But the cavalry has arrived from Saintes, and
I come upstairs to ask Monsieur to come down and help.&nbsp; It is my
husband who is a fool.&nbsp; Holy Virgin! how many times have I regretted
having married such a blockhead as that.&nbsp; He says he cannot raise
the drawbridge.&nbsp; To raise it three feet would be to gain three
hours.&nbsp; So I came to get Monsieur,&rdquo; she pointed at Barebone
with a steady finger, &ldquo;who has his wits on the top always and
two hands at the end of his arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is little use to raise the drawbridge,&rdquo; objected
the Marquis.&nbsp; &ldquo;They will soon get a ladder and place it against
the breach in the wall and climb in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I am on the wall who amuse myself with a hayfork, Monsieur
le Marquis,&rdquo; replied Marie, with that exaggerated respect which
implies a knowledge of mental superiority.&nbsp; She beckoned curtly
to Loo and clattered down the stairs, followed by Barebone.&nbsp; The
others did not attempt to go to their assistance, and the Marquis de
Gemosac had a hundred questions to ask Colville.</p>
<p>The Englishman had little to tell of his own escape.&nbsp; There
were so many more important arrests to be made that the overworked police
of Monsieur de Maupas had only been able to apportion to him a bungler
whom Colville had easily outwitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Madame St. Pierre Lawrence?&rdquo; inquired the Marquis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame quitted Paris on Tuesday for England under the care
of John Turner, who had business in London.&nbsp; He kindly offered
to escort her across the Channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she, at all events, is safe,&rdquo; said the Marquis,
with a little wave of the hand indicating his satisfaction.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
is not brilliant, Monsieur Turner&mdash;so few English are&mdash;but
he is solid, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is the cleverest man I know,&rdquo; said Dormer
Colville, thoughtfully.&nbsp; And before they had spoken again Loo Barebone
returned.</p>
<p>He, like Marie, had grasped at once the serious aspect of the situation,
whereas the Marquis succeeded only in reaching it with a superficial
touch.&nbsp; He prattled of the political crisis in Paris and bade his
friends rest assured that law and order must ultimately prevail.&nbsp;
He even seemed to cherish the comforting assurance that Providence must
in the end interfere on behalf of a Legitimate Succession.&nbsp; For
this old noble was the true son of a father who had believed to the
end in that King who talked grandiloquently of the works of Seneca and
Tacitus while driving from the Temple to his trial, with the mob hooting
and yelling imprecations into the carriage windows.</p>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac found time to give a polite opinion on John
Turner while the streets of Gemosac were being cleared by the cavalry
from Saintes, and the Gendarmerie, burning briskly, lighted up a scene
of bloodshed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have raised the drawbridge a few feet,&rdquo; said Barebone;
&ldquo;but the chains are rusted and may easily be broken by a blacksmith.&nbsp;
It will serve to delay them a few minutes; but it is not the mob we
seek to keep out, and any organised attempt to break in would succeed
in half an hour.&nbsp; We must go, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Colville, with whom he had met and faced difficulties
in the past.&nbsp; Colville might easily have escaped to England with
Mrs. St. Pierre Lawrence, but he had chosen the better part.&nbsp; He
had undertaken a long journey through disturbed France only to throw
in his lot at the end of it with two pre-condemned men.&nbsp; Loo turned
to him as to one who had proved himself capable enough in an emergency,
brave in face of danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot stay here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the gates will
serve to give us an hour&rsquo;s start, but no more.&nbsp; I suppose
there is another way out of the ch&acirc;teau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two ways,&rdquo; answered the Marquis.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
leads to a house in the town and the other emerges at the mill down
below the walls.&nbsp; But, alas! both are lost sight of.&nbsp; My ancestors&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the shorter one,&rdquo; put in Juliette, &ldquo;the
passage that leads to the mill.&nbsp; I can show you the entrance to
that, which is in the crypt of the chapel, hidden behind the casks of
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke to Barebone, only half-concealing, as Marie had done, the
fact that the great respect with which the Marquis de Gemosac was treated
was artificial, and would fall to pieces under the strain of an emergency&mdash;a
faint echo of the old r&eacute;gime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are gone,&rdquo; the girl continued, still addressing
Barebone, &ldquo;Marie and I can keep them out at least an hour&mdash;probably
more.&nbsp; We may be able to keep them outside the walls all night,
and when at last they come in it will take them hours to satisfy themselves
that you are not concealed within the enceinte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was quite cool, and even smiled at him with a white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are always right, Mademoiselle, and have a clear head,&rdquo;
said Barebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no heart?&rdquo; she answered in an undertone, under cover
of her father&rsquo;s endless talk to Colville and with a glance which
Barebone could not understand.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Dormer Colville pronounced himself ready to go,
and refused to waste further precious minutes in response to Monsieur
de Gemosac&rsquo;s offers of hospitality.&nbsp; No dinner had been prepared,
for Marie had sterner business in hand and could be heard beneath the
windows urging her husband to display a courage superior to that of
a rabbit.&nbsp; Juliette hurried to the kitchen and there prepared a
parcel of cold meat and bread for the fugitives to eat as they fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might remain hidden in a remote cottage,&rdquo; Barebone
had suggested to Colville, &ldquo;awaiting the development of events,
but our best chance is &lsquo;The Last Hope.&rsquo;&nbsp; She is at
Bordeaux, and must be nearly ready for sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was hurriedly arranged that they should make their way on foot
to a cottage on the marsh while Jean was despatched to Bordeaux with
a letter for Captain Clubbe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; said Marie, when informed of this plan,
&ldquo;that it is not I who wear the breeches.&nbsp; But I will make
it clear to Jean that if he fails to carry out his task he need not
show his face at the gate again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis ran hither and thither, making a hundred suggestions,
which were accepted in the soothing manner adopted toward children.&nbsp;
He assured Juliette that their absence would be of short duration; that
there was indeed no danger, but that he was acceding to the urgent persuasions
of Barebone and Colville, who were perhaps unnecessarily alarmed&mdash;who
did not understand how affairs were conducted in France.&nbsp; He felt
assured that law and order must prevail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they have put Albert de Chantonnay in prison, why should
you be safe?&rdquo; asked Juliette.&nbsp; To which the Marquis replied
with a meaning cackle that she had a kind heart, and that it was only
natural that it should be occupied at that moment with thoughts of that
excellent young man who, in his turn, was doubtless thinking of her
in his cell at La Rochelle.</p>
<p>Which playful allusion to Albert de Chantonnay&rsquo;s pretensions
was received by their object with a calm indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Jean returns,&rdquo; she said, practically, &ldquo;I
will send him to you at the Br&eacute;monts&rsquo; cottage with food
and clothing.&nbsp; But you must not attempt to communicate with us.&nbsp;
You would only betray your whereabouts and do no good to us.&nbsp; We
shall be quite safe in the ch&acirc;teau.&nbsp; Marie and I and Madame
Maugiron are not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At which the Marquis laughed heartily.&nbsp; It was so amusing to
think that one should be young and pretty and not afraid.&nbsp; In the
mean time Barebone was sealing his letter to Captain Clubbe.&nbsp; He
had written it in the Suffolk dialect, spelling all the words as they
are pronounced on that coast and employing when he could the Danish
and Dutch expressions in daily use on the foreshore, which no French
official seeking to translate could find in any dictionary.</p>
<p>Lao gave his instructions to Jean himself, who received them in a
silence not devoid of intelligence.&nbsp; The man had been round the
walls and reported that nothing stirred beneath them; that there was
more than one fire in the town, and that the streets appeared to be
given over to disorder and riot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is assuredly a change in the Government,&rdquo; he explained,
simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there will be many for Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;
to bury on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean was to accompany them to the cottage of an old man who had once
lived by ferrying the rare passenger across the Gironde.&nbsp; Having
left them here, he could reach Blaye before daylight, from whence a
passage up the river to Bordeaux would be easily procurable.</p>
<p>The boatman&rsquo;s cottage stood on the bank of a creek running
into the Gironde.&nbsp; It was a lone building hidden among the low
dunes that lie between the river and the marsh.&nbsp; Any one approaching
it by daylight would be discernible half an hour in advance, and the
man&rsquo;s boat, though old, was seaworthy.&nbsp; None would care to
cross the lowlands at night except under the guidance of one or two,
who, like Jean, knew their way even in the dark.</p>
<p>Colville and Barebone had to help Jean to move the great casks stored
in the crypt of the old chapel by which the entrance to the passage
was masked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, I recollect having been told, more than a passage&mdash;it
is a ramp,&rdquo; explained the Marquis, who stood by.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was intended for the passage of horses, so that a man might mount here
and ride out into the mill-stream, actually beneath the mill-wheel which
conceals the exit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juliette, a cloak thrown over her evening dress, had accompanied
them and stood near, holding a lantern above her head to give them light.&nbsp;
It was an odd scene&mdash;a strange occupation for the last of the de
Gemosacs.&nbsp; Through the gaps in the toppling walls they could hear
the roar of voices and the occasional report of a firearm in the streets
of the town below.&nbsp; The door opened easily enough, and Jean, lighting
a candle, led the way.&nbsp; Barebone was the last to follow.&nbsp;
Within the doorway he turned to say good-bye.&nbsp; The light of the
lantern flickered uncertainly on Juliette&rsquo;s fair hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be back sooner than you expect, mademoiselle,&rdquo;
said Barebone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or you may go&mdash;to England,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.&nbsp; &ldquo;JOHN DARBY&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Although it was snowing hard, it was not a dark night.&nbsp; There
was a half moon hidden behind those thin, fleecy clouds, which carry
the snow across the North Sea and cast it noiselessly upon the low-lying
coast, from Thanet to the Wash, which knows less rain and more snow
than any in England.</p>
<p>A gale of wind was blowing from the north-east; not in itself a wild
gale, but at short intervals a fresh burst of wind brought with it a
thicker fall of snow, and during these squalls the force of the storm
was terrific.&nbsp; A man, who had waited on the far shore of the river
for a quiet interval, had at last made his way to the Farlingford side.&nbsp;
He moored his boat and stumbled heavily up the steps.</p>
<p>There was no one on the quay.&nbsp; The street was deserted, but
the lights within the cottages glowed warmly through red blinds here
and there.&nbsp; The majority of windows were, however, secured with
a shutter, screwed tight from within.&nbsp; The man trotted steadily
up the street.&nbsp; He had an unmistakable air of discipline.&nbsp;
It was only six o&rsquo;clock, but night had closed in three hours ago.&nbsp;
The coast-guard looked neither to one side nor the other, but ran on
at the pace of one who had run far and knows that he cannot afford to
lose his breath; for his night&rsquo;s work was only begun.</p>
<p>The coast-guard station stands on the left-hand side of the street,
a long, low house in a bare garden.&nbsp; In answer to the loud summons,
a red-faced little man opened the door and let out into the night a
smell of bloaters and tea&mdash;the smell that pervades all Farlingford
at six o&rsquo;clock in the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something on the Inner Curlo Bank,&rdquo; shouted the coast-guard
in his face, and turning on his heel, he ran with the same slow, organised
haste, leaving the red-faced man finishing a mouthful on the mat.</p>
<p>The next place of call was at River Andrew&rsquo;s, the little low
cottage with rounded corners, below the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said the coast-guard, with
a contemptuous glance of snow-rimmed eyes at River Andrew&rsquo;s comfortable
tea-table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ring yer bell.&nbsp; Something on the Inner
Curlo Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>River Andrew had never hurried in his life, and like all his fellows,
he looked upon coast-guards as amateurs mindful, as all amateurs are,
of their clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m now going,&rdquo; he answered, rising laboriously
from his chair.&nbsp; The coast-guard glanced at his feet clad in the
bright green carpet-slippers, dear to seafaring men.&nbsp; Then he turned
to the side of the mantelpiece and took the church keys from the nail.&nbsp;
For everybody knows where everybody else keeps his keys in Farlingford.&nbsp;
He forgot to shut the door behind him, and River Andrew, pessimistically
getting into his sea-boots, swore at his retreating back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely as not, he&rsquo;ll getten howld o&rsquo; the wrong
roup,&rdquo; he muttered; though he knew that every boy in the village
could point out the rope of &ldquo;John Darby,&rdquo; as that which
had a piece of faded scarlet flannel twisted through the strands.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the man, who hastened slowly, gave the call, which
every man in Farlingford answered with an emotionless, mechanical promptitude.&nbsp;
From each fireside some tired worker reached out his hand toward his
most precious possession, his sea-boots, as his forefathers had done
before him for two hundred years at the sound of &ldquo;John Darby.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The women crammed into the pockets of the men&rsquo;s stiff oilskins
a piece of bread, a half-filled bottle&mdash;knowing that, as often
as not, their husbands must pass the night and half the next day on
the beach, or out at sea, should the weather permit a launch through
the surf.</p>
<p>There was no need of excitement, or even of comment.&nbsp; Did not
&ldquo;John Darby&rdquo; call them from their firesides or their beds
a dozen times every winter, to scramble out across the shingle?&nbsp;
As often as not, there was nothing to be done but drag the dead bodies
from the surf; but sometimes the dead revived&mdash;some fair-haired,
mystic foreigner from the northern seas, who came to and said, &ldquo;T&rsquo;ank
you,&rdquo; and nothing else.&nbsp; And next day, rigged out in dry
clothes and despatched toward Ipswich on the carrier&rsquo;s cart, he
would shake hands awkwardly with any standing near and bob his head
and say &ldquo;T&rsquo;ank you&rdquo; again, and go away, monosyllabic,
mystic, never to be heard of more.&nbsp; But the ocean, as it is called
at Farlingford, seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of such Titans
to throw up on the rattling shingle winter after winter.&nbsp; And,
after all, they were seafaring men, and therefore brothers.&nbsp; Farlingford
turned out to a man, each seeking to be first across the river every
time &ldquo;John Darby&rdquo; called them, as if he had never called
them before.</p>
<p>To-night none paused to finish the meal, and many a cup raised half-way
was set down again untasted.&nbsp; It is so easy to be too late.</p>
<p>Already the flicker of lanterns on the sea-wall showed that the rectory
was astir.&nbsp; For Septimus Marvin, vaguely recalling some schoolboy
instinct of fair-play, knew the place of the gentleman and the man of
education among humbler men in moments of danger and hardship, which
should, assuredly, never be at the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder&rsquo;s parson,&rdquo; some one muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
head is clear enow, I&rsquo;ll warrant, when he hears &lsquo;John Darby.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis only on Sundays, when &lsquo;John&rsquo; rings
slow, &rsquo;tis misty,&rdquo; answered a sharp-voiced woman, with a
laugh.&nbsp; For half of Farlingford was already at the quay, and three
or four boats were bumping and splashing against the steps.&nbsp; The
tide was racing out, and the wind, whizzing slantwise across it, pushed
it against the wooden piles of the quay, making them throb and tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not less&rsquo;n four to the oars!&rdquo; shouted a gruff
voice, at the foot of the steps, where the salt water, splashing on
the snow, had laid bare the green and slimy moss.&nbsp; Two or three
volunteers stumbled down the steps, and the first boat got away, swinging
down-stream at once, only to be brought slowly back, head to wind.&nbsp;
She hung motionless a few yards from the quay, each dip of the oars
stirring the water into a whirl of phosphorescence, and then forged
slowly ahead.</p>
<p>Septimus Marvin was not alone, but was accompanied by a bulky man,
not unknown in Farlingford&mdash;John Turner, of Ipswich, understood
to live &ldquo;foreign,&rdquo; but to return, after the manner of East
Anglians, when occasion offered.&nbsp; The rector was in oilskins and
sou&rsquo;wester, like any one else, and the gleam of his spectacles
under the snowy brim of his headgear seemed to strike no one as incongruous.&nbsp;
His pockets bulged with bottles and bandages.&nbsp; Under his arm he
carried a couple of blanket horse-cloths, useful for carrying the injured
or the dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Curlo&mdash;the Inner Curlo&mdash;yes, yes!&rdquo; he
shouted in response to information volunteered on all sides.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor
fellows!&nbsp; The Inner Curlo, dear, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he groped his way down the steps, into the first boat he saw,
with a simple haste.&nbsp; John Turner followed him.&nbsp; He had tied
a silk handkerchief over his soft felt hat and under his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he said, as Septimus Marvin made room for him
on the after-thwart.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too heavy for a passenger.&nbsp;
Put my weight on an oar,&rdquo; and he clambered forward to a vacant
thwart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you come back for us, River Andrew!&rdquo; cried little
Sep&rsquo;s thin voice, as the boat swirled down stream.&nbsp; His wavering
bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern followed it, and showed River Andrew and another
pulling stroke to John Turner&rsquo;s bow, for the banker had been a
famous oar on the Orwell in his boyhood.&nbsp; Then, with a smack like
a box on the ear, another snow-squall swept in from the sea, and forced
all on the quay to turn their backs and crouch.&nbsp; Many went back
to their homes, knowing that nothing could be known for some hours.&nbsp;
Others crouched on the landward side of an old coal-shed, peeping round
the corner.</p>
<p>Miriam and Sep, and a few others, waited on the quay until River
Andrew or another should return.&nbsp; It was an understood thing that
the helpers, such as could man a boat or carry a drowned man, should
go first.&nbsp; In a few minutes the squall was past, and by the light
of the moon, now thinly covered by clouds, the black forms of the first
to reach the other shore could be seen straggling across the marsh toward
the great shingle-bank that lies between the river and the sea.&nbsp;
Two boats were moored at the far side, another was just making the jetty,
while a fourth was returning toward the quay.&nbsp; It was River Andrew,
faithful to his own element, who preferred to be first here, rather
than obey orders on the open beach.</p>
<p>There were several ready to lend a helping hand against tide and
wind, and Miriam and Sep were soon struggling across the shingle, in
the footsteps of those who had gone before.&nbsp; The north-east wind
seared their faces like a hot iron, but the snow had ceased falling.&nbsp;
As they reached the summit of the shingle-bank, they could see in front
of them the black line of the sea, and on the beach, where the white
of the snow and the white of the roaring surf merged together, a group
of men.</p>
<p>One or two stragglers had left this group to search the beach, north
or south; but it was known, from a long and grim experience, that anything
floating in from the tail of the Inner Curlo Bank must reach the shore
at one particular point.&nbsp; A few lanterns twinkled here and there,
but near the group of watchers a bonfire of wreckage and tarry fragments
and old rope, brought hither for the purpose, had been kindled.</p>
<p>Two boats, hauled out of reach of a spring tide, were being leisurely
prepared for launching.&nbsp; There was no hurry; for it had been decided
by the older men that no boat could be put to sea through the surf then
rolling in.&nbsp; At the turn of the tide, in two hours&rsquo; time,
something might be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us cannot see anything,&rdquo; a bystander said to Miriam.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is just there, where I am pointing.&nbsp; Sea Andrew saw something
a while back&mdash;says it looked like a schooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stood pointing out to sea to the southward.&nbsp; He carried
an unlighted torch&mdash;a flare, roughly made, of tarred rope, bound
round a stick.&nbsp; At times, one or another would ignite his flare,
and go down the beach holding it above his head, while he stood knee
deep in the churning foam to peer out to sea.&nbsp; He would presently
return, without comment, to beat out his flare against his foot and
take his place among the silent watchers.&nbsp; No one spoke; but if
any turned his head sharply to one side or other, all the rest wheeled,
like one man, in the same direction and after staring at the tumbled
sea would turn reproachful glances on the false alarmist.</p>
<p>Suddenly, after a long wait, four men rushed without a word into
the surf; their silent fury suggesting oddly the rush of hounds upon
a fox.&nbsp; They had simultaneously caught sight of something dark,
half sunk in the shallow water.&nbsp; In a moment they were struggling
up the shingle slope toward the fire, carrying a heavy weight.&nbsp;
They laid their burden by the fire, where the snow had melted away,
and it was a man.&nbsp; He was in oilskins, and some one cut the tape
that tied his sou&rsquo;wester.&nbsp; His face was covered with blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis warm,&rdquo; said the man who had cut away the
oilskin cap, and with his hand he wiped the blood away from the eyes
and mouth.&nbsp; Some one in the background drew a cork, with his teeth,
and a bottle was handed down to those kneeling on the ground.</p>
<p>Suddenly the man sat up&mdash;and coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shipmets,&rdquo; he said, with a splutter, and lay down again.&nbsp;
Some one held the bottle to his lips and wiped the blood away from his
face again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; shouted a bystander, gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
William Brooke, of the Cottages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis me,&rdquo; said the man, sitting up
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not that arm, mate; don&rsquo;t ye touch it.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis bruk.&nbsp; Yes; &rsquo;tis me.&nbsp; And &lsquo;The Last
Hope&rsquo; is on the tail of the Inner Curlo&mdash;and the spar that
knocked me overboard fell on the old man, and must have half killed
him.&nbsp; But Loo Barebone&rsquo;s aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose to his knees, with one arm hanging straight and piteous from
his shoulder, then slowly to his feet.&nbsp; He stood wavering for a
moment, and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and spluttered.&nbsp;
Then, looking straight in front of him, with that strange air of a whipped
dog which humble men wear when the hand of Heaven is upon them, he staggered
up the beach toward the river and Farlingford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are ye goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; some one asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to mine,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;A&rsquo;m
going to my old woman, shipmets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he staggered away in the darkness.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>CHAPTER XL.&nbsp; FARLINGFORD ONCE MORE</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>After a hurried consultation, Septimus Marvin was deputed to follow
the injured man and take him home, seeing that he had as yet but half
recovered his senses.&nbsp; This good Samaritan had scarcely disappeared
when a shout from the beach drew the attention of all in another direction.</p>
<p>One of the outposts was running toward the fire, waving his lantern
and shouting incoherently.&nbsp; It was a coastguard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comin&rsquo; ashore in their own boat,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming in in their own boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she rides&mdash;there she rides!&rdquo; added Sea Andrew,
almost immediately, and he pointed to the south.</p>
<p>Quite close in, just outside the line of breakers, a black shadow
was rising and falling on the water.&nbsp; It seemed to make scarcely
any way at all, and each sea that curled underneath the boat and roared
toward the beach was a new danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to run her in here,&rdquo; said Sea Andrew.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more left on board; that&rsquo;s what that means,
and they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; back for &rsquo;em.&nbsp; If &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t
so they&rsquo;d run in anywheres and let her break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one sailor will always tell what another is about, however great
the distance intervening.</p>
<p>Slowly the boat came on, rolling tremendously on the curve of the
breakers, between the broken water of the tideway and the spume of the
surf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Loo at the hellum,&rdquo; said Sea Andrew&mdash;the
keenest eyes in Farlingford.</p>
<p>And suddenly Miriam swayed sideways against John Turner, who was
perhaps watching her, for he gripped her arm and stood firm.&nbsp; No
one spoke.&nbsp; The watchers on the beach stared open-mouthed, making
unconscious grimaces as the boat rose and fell.&nbsp; All had been ready
for some minutes; every preparation made according to the time-honoured
use of these coasts: four men with life-lines round them standing knee-deep
waiting to dash in deeper, others behind them grouped in two files,
some holding the slack of the life-lines, forming a double rank from
the shore to the fire, giving the steersman his course.&nbsp; There
was no need to wave a torch or shout an order.&nbsp; They were Farlingford
men on the shore and Farlingford men in the boat.</p>
<p>At last, after breathless moments of suspense, the boat turned, and
came spinning in on the top of a breaker, with the useless oars sticking
out like the legs of some huge insect.&nbsp; For a few seconds it was
impossible to distinguish anything.&nbsp; The moment the boat touched
ground, the waves beating on it enveloped all near it in a whirl of
spray, and the black forms seemed to be tumbling over each other in
confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Turner to Miriam, &ldquo;he has come
back to you after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer but stood, her two hands clasped together on her
breast, seeking to disentangle the confused group, half in half out
of the water.</p>
<p>Then they heard Loo Barebone&rsquo;s voice, cheerful and energetic,
almost laughing.&nbsp; Before they could understand what was taking
place his voice was audible again, giving a sharp, clear order, and
all the black forms rushed together down into the surf.&nbsp; A moment
later the boat danced out over the crest of a breaker, splashing into
the next and throwing up a fan of spray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s through, she&rsquo;s through!&rdquo; cried some
one.&nbsp; And the boat rode for a brief minute head to wind before
she turned southward.&nbsp; There were only three on the thwarts&mdash;Loo
Barebone and two others.</p>
<p>The group now broke up and straggled up toward the fire.&nbsp; One
man was being supported, and could scarcely walk.&nbsp; It was Captain
Clubbe, hatless, his grey hair plastered across his head by salt water.</p>
<p>He did not heed any one, but sat down heavily on the shingle and
felt his leg with one hand, the other arm hung limply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me here,&rdquo; he said, gruffly, to two or three who
were spreading out a horse-cloth and preparing to carry him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
I stay till all are ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind him were several new-comers, one of them a little man talking
excitedly to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is a folly,&rdquo; he was saying in French, &ldquo;to
go back in such a sea as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Marquis de Gemosac, and no one was taking any notice of
him.&nbsp; Dormer Colville, stumbling over the shingle beside him, recognised
Miriam in the firelight and turned again to look at her companion as
if scarcely believing the evidence of his own eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Turner?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are all
here,&mdash;the Marquis, Barebone, and I.&nbsp; Clubbe took us on board
one dark night in the Gironde and brought us home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; asked Turner, curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&nbsp; But Clubbe&rsquo;s collar-bone is broken and
his leg is crushed.&nbsp; We had to leave four on board; not room for
them in the boat.&nbsp; That fool Barebone has gone back for them.&nbsp;
He promised them he would.&nbsp; The sea out there is awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knelt down and held his shaking hands to the flames.&nbsp; Some
one handed him a bottle, but he turned first and gave it the Marquis
de Gemosac, who was shaking all over like one far gone in a palsy.</p>
<p>Sea Andrew and the coast-guard captain were persuading Captain Clubbe
to quit the beach, but he only answered them roughly in monosyllables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My place is here till all are safe,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a groan of pain he lay back on the beach.&nbsp; Miriam folded
a blanket and placed it under his head.&nbsp; He looked round, recognised
her and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No place for you, miss,&rdquo; he said, and closed his eyes.&nbsp;
After a moment he raised himself on his elbow and looked into the faces
peering down at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loo will beach her anywhere he can.&nbsp; Keep a bright lookout
for him,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Then he was silent, and all turned their
faces toward the sea.</p>
<p>Another snow-squall swept in with a rush from the eastward, and half
of the fire was blown away&mdash;a trail of sparks hissing on the snow.&nbsp;
They built up the fire again and waited, crouching low over the embers.&nbsp;
They could see nothing out to sea.&nbsp; There was nothing to be done
but to wait.&nbsp; Some had gone along the shore to the south, keeping
pace with the supposed progress of the boat, ready to help should she
be thrown ashore.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Marquis de Gemosac, shivering over the fire, raised
his voice querulously.&nbsp; His emotions always found vent in speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a folly,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;that he has committed.&nbsp;
I do not understand, gentlemen, how he was permitted to do such a thing&mdash;he
whose life is of value to millions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his head to glance sharply at Captain Clubbe, at Colville,
at Turner, who listened with that half-contemptuous silence which Englishmen
oppose to unnecessary or inopportune speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you do not understand&mdash;you
Englishmen&mdash;or you do not believe, perhaps, that he is the King.&nbsp;
You would demand proofs which you know cannot be produced.&nbsp; I demand
no proofs, for I know.&nbsp; I know without any proof at all but his
face, his manner, his whole being.&nbsp; I knew at once when I saw him
step out of his boat here in this sad village, and I have lived with
him almost daily ever since&mdash;only to be more sure than at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hearers made no answer.&nbsp; They listened tolerantly enough,
as one listens to a child or to any other incapable of keeping to the
business in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know more than you suspect,&rdquo; said the Marquis,
suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are some even in our own party who have
doubts, who are not quite sure.&nbsp; I know that there was a doubt
as to that portrait of the Queen,&rdquo; he half glanced toward Dormer
Colville.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some say one thing, some another.&nbsp; I have
been told that, when the child&mdash;Monsieur de Bourbon&rsquo;s father&mdash;landed
here, there were two portraits among his few possessions&mdash;the miniature
and a larger print, an engraving.&nbsp; Where is that engraving, one
would ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it in my safe in Paris,&rdquo; said a thick voice in
the darkness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thought it was better in my possession than
anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; And now, Monsieur Turner&mdash;&rdquo; the Marquis
raised himself on his knees and pointed in his eager way a thin finger
in the direction of the banker&mdash;&ldquo;tell me this.&nbsp; Those
portraits to which some would attach importance&mdash;they are of the
Duchess de Guiche.&nbsp; Admitted?&nbsp; Good!&nbsp; If you yourself&mdash;who
have the reputation of being a man of wit&mdash;desired to secure the
escape of a child and his nurse, would you content yourself with the
mere precaution of concealing the child&rsquo;s identity?&nbsp; Would
you not go farther and provide the nurse with a subterfuge, a blind,
something for the woman to produce and say, &lsquo;This is not the little
Dauphin.&nbsp; This is so-and-so.&nbsp; See, here is the portrait of
his mother?&rsquo;&nbsp; What so effective, I ask you?&nbsp; What so
likely to be believed as a scandal directed against the hated aristocrats?&nbsp;
Can you advance anything against that theory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Turner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Monsieur de Bourbon knows of these doubts,&rdquo; went
on the Marquis.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have even touched his own mind, I
know that.&nbsp; But he has continued to fight undaunted.&nbsp; He has
made sacrifices&mdash;any looking at his face can see that.&nbsp; It
was not in France that he looked for happiness, but elsewhere.&nbsp;
He was not heart-whole&mdash;I who have seen him with the most beautiful
women in France paying court to him know that.&nbsp; But this sacrifice,
also, he made for the sake of France.&nbsp; Or perhaps some woman of
whom we know nothing stepped back and bade him go forward alone, for
the sake of his own greatness&mdash;who can tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again no one answered him.&nbsp; He had not perceived Miriam, and
John Turner, with that light step which sometimes goes with a vast bulk,
had placed himself between her and the firelight.&nbsp; Monsieur de
Gemosac rose to his feet and stood looking seaward.&nbsp; The snow-clouds
were rolling away to the west, and the moon, breaking through, was beginning
to illumine the wild sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Marquis, &ldquo;they have been
gone a long time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Clubbe moved restlessly, but he made no answer.&nbsp; The
Marquis had, of course, spoken in French, and the Captain had no use
for that language.</p>
<p>The group round the fire had dwindled until only half a dozen remained.&nbsp;
One after another the watchers had moved away uneasily toward the beach.&nbsp;
The Marquis was right&mdash;the boat had been gone too long.</p>
<p>At last the moon broke through, and the snowy scene was almost as
light as day.</p>
<p>John Turner was looking along the beach to the south, and one after
another the watchers by the fire turned their anxious eyes in the same
direction.&nbsp; The sea, whipped white, was bare of any wreck.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Last Hope&rdquo; of Farlingford was gone.&nbsp; She had broken
up or rolled into deep water.</p>
<p>A number of men were coming up the shingle in silence.&nbsp; Sea
Andrew, dragging his feet wearily, approached in advance of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boat&rsquo;s thrown up on the beach,&rdquo; he said to Captain
Clubbe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stove in by a sea.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve found them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood back and the others, coming slowly into the light, deposited
their burdens side by side near the fire.&nbsp; The Marquis, who had
understood nothing, took a torch from the hand of a bystander and held
it down toward the face of the man they had brought last.</p>
<p>It was Loo Barebone, and the clean-cut, royal features seemed to
wear a reflective smile.</p>
<p>Miriam had come forward toward the fire, and by chance or by some
vague instinct the bearers had laid their burden at her feet.&nbsp;
After all, as John Turner had said, Loo Barebone had come back to her.&nbsp;
She had denied him twice, and the third time he would take no denial.&nbsp;
The taciturn sailors laid him there and stepped back&mdash;as if he
was hers and this was the inevitable end of his short and stormy voyage.</p>
<p>She looked down at him with tired eyes.&nbsp; She had done the right,
and this was the end.&nbsp; There are some who may say that she had
done what she thought was right, and this only seemed to be the end.&nbsp;
It may be so.</p>
<p>The Marquis de Gemosac was dumb for once.&nbsp; He looked round him
with a half-defiant question in his eyes.&nbsp; Then he pointed a lean
finger down toward the dead man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others may question,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I know&mdash;I
<i>know</i>.&rdquo;</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
